00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,892
Podium Podcast. The best is yet to be heard.

2
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:25,694
Hello, Carmen. How are you? Very well, how about you? I'm feeling cheerful.

3
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:29,679
How strange, right? We are happy today. And it's incredibly cold.

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,244
It's cold, but we are... Despite the regrets, which are many.

5
00:00:33,264 --> 00:00:37,690
The sorrows are. We are happy, I think partly because yesterday we did.

6
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,812
something good. Yesterday we went out, well we went out, we went to a bar.

7
00:00:42,073 --> 00:00:45,395
We hadn't set foot in a bar since we arrived in September, a bar in Provins.

8
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:50,339
Bar, bar, not me. Yes, I do.

9
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:54,101
Well, but... Okay, fine. Anyway, we went out for a while yesterday,

10
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:57,403
we drank some wines, we ate some oysters.

11
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,726
We ate some oysters. The oysters from Rhode Island... Look,

12
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:04,147
We always speak ill of Rhode Island, but the truth is, Rhode Island is not to blame at all.

13
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:07,850
It is a beautiful place. But the oysters are delicious.

14
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:11,753
The oysters are very delicious here and also, it's what I was telling you about yesterday.

15
00:01:11,813 --> 00:01:15,195
Ana, even though it sounds very ostentatious to say that you have gone to eat

16
00:01:15,215 --> 00:01:17,916
oysters... It's the only cheap thing here. Actually, it's the only thing here that

17
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:20,818
the price difference with Spain is not noticeable, so we decided to go.

18
00:01:21,238 --> 00:01:23,640
Similarly, we went to a place where you enter and they spit in your face.

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,882
directly. Yes, yes, that one is spectacular. We ordered oysters, they gave them to us.

20
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:30,524
They brought us and almost kicked us out immediately. Yes, they almost spat in our eye.

21
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:35,147
What have you eaten today? What have I eaten today? I have eaten a packed lunch here.

22
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:39,089
same in this building. What a pity, the word tupper always makes me feel very sorry.

23
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:41,070
That is something that I never do, honestly. Me neither. I'm going to

24
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,393
home immediately to eat at my house, but I have already eaten.

25
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:48,775
Tupperware to later record this, what was left over from yesterday's meal.

26
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:51,417
that was very delicious. What was it? I have to say it. Well, look.

27
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:55,258
I made some lentils, like I boiled lentils with

28
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:58,600
rice, a few, and then I sautéed some garlic,

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,561
And there I jumped very crumbled broccoli.

30
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:06,422
The one from Márquezcher. The one from Márquezcher, obviously. Also,

31
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:10,024
this is... no, and like this beet that is called radish,

32
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:14,445
like... That thing they gave us. That very strange thing that has an aspect like

33
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:17,927
of red and white caramel and as a name

34
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:20,648
of, I don't know, of surgery, a radiquia, I don't know. Yes, yes, yes, I don't remember.

35
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:24,796
now the name as the name of an artery. Well, that sautéed with

36
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:28,084
mustard and what else did I put in?

37
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,610
Ah, and then smoked salmon. Well, it was a bit mixed. Ah, and did you send me a

38
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,650
Photo? It looked really good. Well, basically I ate that. What have you eaten?

39
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,371
Well, it sounds very precarious because it has been somewhat borrowed, but it is quite good.

40
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:42,212
rich. Well, I have made a salad, boiled some potatoes and a

41
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:45,833
egg and I have mixed it with

42
00:02:45,873 --> 00:02:49,453
some cherry tomatoes, some capers, and a little bit of feta cheese.

43
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:52,834
That you love capers. I love capers very much.

44
00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:55,035
And then I made myself a small salad with that and then I drank it.

45
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:58,676
a coffee. And now, as we wanted something sweet, we are eating.

46
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:01,399
something very uncharacteristic of us, who are people,

47
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,504
we are eating some M&M's that have already made us feel sickly sweet. Yes,

48
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:09,067
M&M's will never sponsor us again. Well, I'm sorry.

49
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:12,591
Carmen. If by any chance you had considered sponsoring a podcast.

50
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,634
of baroque and nuns, well not anymore. Not anymore.

51
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:21,120
Another question I want to add. Tell me. Not to make the, I mean,

52
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,142
this question is not going to be added to our routines, but I want to ask it today,

53
00:03:24,262 --> 00:03:27,985
although now, due to the mood we are in today, quite uncharacteristic of us here,

54
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:31,247
but well, we have it and let's enjoy it. It doesn't seem like,

55
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:34,830
But I'm going to ask you anyway. Tell me. Have you cried today? Not today.

56
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,113
Other days yes. Other days yes. Other days we cry, not today.

57
00:03:39,273 --> 00:03:41,995
And yes, I believe that yes, if at 20 minutes to 5 of the

58
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:46,098
it has not been cried in the afternoon, it is no longer cried. Because you are not a crybaby.

59
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:49,179
like that at night. No, I am a crier in the mornings.

60
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:52,460
If I cry, it's in the mornings. It's just that many times, well, many times,

61
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,001
Some, I am still opening one of the eyes.

62
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:59,502
and I already see that she is crying and I say, at what moment?

63
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:02,743
I have already given her time to cry, to grieve.

64
00:04:02,803 --> 00:04:05,544
Enough to cry? You have cried today.

65
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,041
I haven't cried today either. No, no, no. But this thing you're saying about the schedule

66
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:12,282
it is important because the other day I read, in fact,

67
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:16,112
that, you know? This actress, like from the Hollywood of the 30s,

68
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,882
that she was a child prodigy, Shirley Temple, because I read that

69
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:23,424
The girl is, whenever she had to shoot something.

70
00:04:23,444 --> 00:04:26,745
crying scene, he used to do it before mealtime. Because he said

71
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:30,046
she, you see, so small already, was very wise, she said that crying

72
00:04:30,446 --> 00:04:33,827
it was super difficult for him with a full stomach. I think it's true, I mean,

73
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:37,188
I believe because it's like the stomach.

74
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:40,929
I always feel fullness as a state of quite sublimation.

75
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:43,569
and happiness that doesn't allow you to cry. In fact, I believe, I mean, I for

76
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:46,310
At least if I cry, if I have a bad day and cry, it's in the mornings.

77
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,871
and it is before breakfast. In other words, at the moment when you are already eating.

78
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:52,291
something delicious, comes in as a distraction. I believe the body

79
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,792
he is also like investing his energies into something else, like doing

80
00:04:55,832 --> 00:04:57,813
digestion and such. Very smart, Shirley Temple.

81
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:02,615
Marta López Álamo should learn from this, as she is a

82
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:06,717
person we follow, whom we wrote to once and never got a reply, as if not

83
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:09,858
we understand why really. Because this person is very

84
00:05:09,878 --> 00:05:13,840
of doing a fast, the fast invites crying, it invites tears. It invites tears.

85
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,402
fasting a lot. Well, let's see, Ana, you know,

86
00:05:18,582 --> 00:05:21,164
because I've already mentioned this to you, that something gives me a

87
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:24,685
A little bit of fear lately, actually not a little bit, it terrifies me, directly.

88
00:05:24,705 --> 00:05:28,087
A little bit of dreadful fear. It's that without realizing it, we are.

89
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:31,348
sinning too much by being too whiny, too plaintive,

90
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,870
that we end up tiring people out with our constant harping on about the lockdown,

91
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,052
in the little cell... It would make me very sad and it does.

92
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:42,974
much fear that even our most loyal listeners will end up getting tired of us.

93
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:47,316
Bi-monthly whining. The other day my mother told me she had listened to the episode.

94
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:50,937
of the imprisoned, that one who gave us so many problems, even though he was

95
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:55,119
Wonderful, we must say, that she had heard it and told me, beware, you are truly.

96
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,241
very distressed. But of course, let's see, it's just that I

97
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:02,222
sometimes yes, being here, and you too, I think you do it

98
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:05,783
you're handling it a bit better, although we have our days, but we do feel it.

99
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:09,485
like absolute paupers working from sunup to sundown, from Monday to

100
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:11,906
Sunday, unable to have even a measly gilda,

101
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:15,487
not even a skewer of tortillas, there are very few escapes.

102
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:19,869
But I don't think we are so extremely mournful, because recording

103
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:21,490
It is our space for healing.

104
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:27,194
But if Pino says it, be careful. If I suspect it is

105
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:29,676
one thing, but if Pino says it... Pino said the other day that in

106
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:33,579
The last one we were extremely whiny. It's just that it can.

107
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:37,262
become a bit pitiful. Let's see, I totally agree with this.

108
00:06:37,282 --> 00:06:40,524
daily distress of not being able to go down for a slice of tortilla,

109
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:42,426
even though yesterday we ate quite a few oysters.

110
00:06:42,846 --> 00:06:46,208
But I wonder why, if as you say,

111
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:49,890
this podcast is precisely our little moment of respite,

112
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,572
Why aren't we managing to park our sorrows for a little while?

113
00:06:53,592 --> 00:06:57,575
recording? Do you know why we won't at least try to simulate a

114
00:06:57,615 --> 00:07:01,457
A little bit of revelry? Today we are happy and it's not a simulation. It's just that we find it hard to pretend.

115
00:07:01,597 --> 00:07:04,939
Of course, we are not about pretending. We are not people of simulations.

116
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:08,127
But I can't help but think, I think,

117
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,849
I wonder...

118
00:07:15,854 --> 00:07:19,177
Why are we insisting?

119
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:22,900
in inspiring so much pity from here?

120
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,464
From what darkest corner of ours do these characters emerge?

121
00:07:27,484 --> 00:07:30,386
What are we building that is pitiful? The other day,

122
00:07:30,406 --> 00:07:33,967
a lovely girl, Beatriz Sánchez Santidrían, interviewed us

123
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:37,788
for Success Express. I enjoyed it a lot. Me too, it was a wonderful interview.

124
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:41,409
He asked us really cool questions, honestly, we enjoyed them a lot. And one of the questions

125
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:44,829
I was going that way, not by our tone.

126
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:49,050
whiny and all, the poor girl didn't say any of that, she was very nice, but yes.

127
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,451
he talked to us about character building. He took it for granted.

128
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:56,052
sitting, as if there was some character building here, which I suppose there is, that is

129
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:59,488
like this. And we always say, it's true,

130
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:02,890
I believe it's true that this podcast is our therapeutic refuge.

131
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,252
So we might always be complaining here about sharing.

132
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:10,034
relief, perhaps. But the other day,

133
00:08:10,354 --> 00:08:14,476
Ana, while reading an article that I read, I came across with

134
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:17,938
a term of those that only still exist in English, you know? And I thought,

135
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:22,079
Let's see if we will be doing Sad Fishing.

136
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,901
Sad Fishing. I love it because here we not only recover baroque little words that

137
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:30,323
They entice us a lot and allow us to diagnose as feelings.

138
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,583
and feelings that have remained somewhat unnamed today, but that

139
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:37,446
We are also always at the forefront of lexicography. Always. Always at the forefront of lexicography.

140
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:41,287
Like when you taught me and all our listeners about that thing of

141
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:44,389
the... Now every time I'm with my phone before putting it to sleep, I think about it.

142
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:48,451
from Bedtime Revenge Procrastination. Although I suspect

143
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:53,235
where things are headed, what is sad fishing? I have

144
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:56,318
agreed, before answering that, of another

145
00:08:56,358 --> 00:09:01,182
thing we translated, that about the bodywork as accomplices

146
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:04,865
bodily. In honor of our Maria de San Jose. Indeed, this is the podcast.

147
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:08,627
from La Vanguardia Léxica, of course. Well, the term sad fishing

148
00:09:08,987 --> 00:09:13,008
It is used to refer to the movement, both vulnerable and calculated, of sharing.

149
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:16,289
in public, and well, especially on social networks, because your sorrows,

150
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:19,590
your hardships, your tears, with the intention of achieving

151
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,550
likes, attention, followers, compassion, in other words, looking, in short, for a little bath.

152
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,911
Of virtual caresses, right? That's normal. You can't blame that.

153
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:29,812
It's just that I won't be the one to do it, neither will you.

154
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:33,613
Of course not. And he was accused of abusing this.

155
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,855
performative vulnerability of satfishing, for example,

156
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:41,298
to Bella Hadid. Gorgeous. Because in November.

157
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:45,040
from 2021... I think it was in

158
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,382
November, in other words, I may have noted it down incorrectly, but not in November of 2021.

159
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:52,044
I have secured the exact day for you. It's okay, it's okay. I know.

160
00:09:52,084 --> 00:09:54,265
that you love a date. I like the dates of our centuries more.

161
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:56,546
favorites in history, the rest matter little to me. The day Bela

162
00:09:56,586 --> 00:09:59,528
Hadid posted made her satfishing you don't care more.

163
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:04,071
Well, that day I already posted a handful of selfies on Instagram that harvested

164
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:07,394
2 and a half million likes. It's no small thing. It's said quickly. And they were.

165
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:11,378
photos in which she appeared completely broken down in tears. That is, with swollen eyes,

166
00:10:11,438 --> 00:10:15,221
the red nose, of course equally gorgeous despite all the hot flashes.

167
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:19,444
The thing is, be careful, because crying to a certain extent can be quite beautifying.

168
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:23,628
I believe. I mean, well, we're going to talk about this. Even so, I don't know.

169
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:26,731
If I am convinced by the idea that you and I, from our little cells in Rhode

170
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,794
Island, let's be doing South Fishing.

171
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:33,777
I don't think we should be putting on this performance of mourners.

172
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:37,761
We can call the South Fishing performance a lamentation performance. Performance of

173
00:10:37,841 --> 00:10:40,544
wailing from our little cell in Rhode Island.

174
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:44,156
Hey, first of all, well, as you say, we're going to discuss this later.

175
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:47,556
But this idea that tears beautify, be careful because there are many things to say here.

176
00:10:47,576 --> 00:10:50,797
and many things have also been said in our most favorite centuries of the

177
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:54,298
story. But well, since we are not convinced by the idea

178
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:57,618
from the therapeutic exercise nor the idea of sad fishing

179
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:01,499
they satisfy us neither as a response to our own tears, nor to the tears

180
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:05,160
from Bella Hadid's selfies, nor from so many people's since

181
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,641
her Instagram live streams, And as you already know, friends, that anything

182
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:12,183
What is happening to you now has already happened to someone else, probably a nun.

183
00:11:12,223 --> 00:11:15,324
the 16th and 17th centuries, in this episode we are going to

184
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:18,565
try to illuminate the crying of the 21st century by investigating,

185
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:22,907
as always, in our most favorite centuries of history. Long live! You have done it.

186
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:26,569
super solemn. So prepare yourselves for the copious.

187
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:29,910
spill that floods this episode about the gift of tears

188
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,271
and the rhetoric of crying.

189
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,242
Felipe's daughters, with Ana Garriga

190
00:11:44,262 --> 00:11:45,803
and Carmen Urbita.

191
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:53,469
A podcast with all the bling-bling of the centuries

192
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:57,072
XVI and XVII, produced by Podium.

193
00:11:57,172 --> 00:12:02,596
Podcast.

194
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:04,538
These tears are my sustenance.

195
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:25,415
I like

196
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:28,136
A lot of Juan Gabriel. I also do, who wouldn't like Juan Gabriel?

197
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:30,077
Please, it's just wonderful.

198
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:34,719
I really like this song, I mean, it's a song by Juan Gabriel that is

199
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:38,560
every cry, is already a cry, a complaint and a protest

200
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,782
at the same time, like someone who resists suffering, who would not want to cry.

201
00:12:42,342 --> 00:12:46,404
But the secret to start alleviating some discomforts, and this

202
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:50,025
We have discussed this, you and I, perhaps it's about not resisting them.

203
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:54,247
You were telling me this the other day. Embrace it. Simply embrace it.

204
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:56,108
discomfort. Forward! Forward like Ripta!

205
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:01,511
Sorry, but this came out very naturally because we say it constantly.

206
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:05,073
RIPTA is the bus company in Rhode Island that, when we returned from COVID,

207
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:07,814
in other words, when we returned to Providence after COVID,

208
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:12,437
Of course, since there is a large Spanish-speaking population in Rhode Island, there was a

209
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:16,299
message that said FORWARD as if to get out of COVID, so now Carmen and I

210
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:19,961
To cheer us up every morning is like moving FORWARD.

211
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:23,463
like RIPTA. Perpetual smile, FORWARD like RIPTA,

212
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:23,843
that's it.

213
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:37,068
I don't want us to fall into the rhetoric of unnecessary lamentation,

214
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:40,789
even though later we are going to see a certain charm, but we must

215
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:43,350
start seeing it, perhaps crying not as a punishment,

216
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,373
but as a gift. Let's start there. And for that, you

217
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,776
I am going to read a few words from Maria de

218
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:56,802
Oigne. But she was.

219
00:13:56,842 --> 00:14:00,204
from the French zone. Where were you from? It's just that maybe it was like... Ah,

220
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:02,707
No, he was Belgian. But he was still from the Flemish region.

221
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:06,708
Well, Maria. The friend

222
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:10,189
Maria was a Belgian mystic who lived between the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

223
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:14,210
XII and the beginning of the XIII. In other words, we are going to be mischievous again here,

224
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,631
anachronistic. But it's just that Maria deserves it.

225
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:20,292
She got married,

226
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:24,653
but before turning 30, he has a life crisis. And that is, friends,

227
00:14:25,273 --> 00:14:27,974
it doesn't matter if it's the 12th century, it doesn't matter if it's now, if you get married

228
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:31,356
Before 30, I tell you this from experience, by God,

229
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:35,158
that you are going to have a monumental life crisis, that's how it is.

230
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:38,060
Well, she, of course, already had the excuse of the 12th century, so she gets married.

231
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:43,388
But suddenly, in the midst of that life crisis, she explains to her husband that

232
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:46,748
wants to devote themselves to religious life. They break off the marriage,

233
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:51,249
everyone extremely happy, and Maria withdraws to a community of

234
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:54,770
neighbors, that this, if you already know us, you come listening to us

235
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,511
For a long time, you have known that it is a community of women who lived.

236
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:02,891
together, outside of any religious order, but also dedicated to contemplative tasks,

237
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:06,472
to daily tasks and taking care of each other. In other words, a dream. An absolute.

238
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:10,375
dream. We never or almost never actually talk about Las Veguinas.

239
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:13,697
and we absolutely owe an episode because there are also several listeners who

240
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:16,839
it has been recommended to us / ordered so it will arrive.

241
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,241
The episode of Las Veguinas will arrive. Then they ask us if we are not afraid.

242
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:23,723
that we run out of topics. Never, it's the least of our worries.

243
00:15:23,743 --> 00:15:27,325
the least of our worries. Of the entire list. Of the list of worries that

244
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:30,227
us running out of topics is never one. Well then, Maria.

245
00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:34,429
She became famous, mainly because she had the mystical grace of the stigmata.

246
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:37,431
A bit like my grandmother. But...

247
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:43,643
He doesn't listen to me, so it doesn't matter. But also... And to

248
00:15:43,663 --> 00:15:46,604
see, this is where I wanted to get to, your whirlwind of tears, Maria.

249
00:15:46,884 --> 00:15:50,325
And the thing is, she enjoyed it immensely. She was a little pleasure-seeker.

250
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:54,227
from crying. That's it. Look, he/she was saying... These are these tears.

251
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:57,949
my delicacy, my daily bread, day and night. I don't

252
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:00,670
They afflict the head, but nourish my understanding.

253
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,391
They are my torment without pain. They renew my soul with a

254
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:07,794
very deep peace. They don't empty my head, but rather they me

255
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:10,816
they fill the soul, calming it with the sweetest anointing,

256
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:15,460
as long as they are not called with violence, but freely given by

257
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,524
the Lord as a healing potion. Spectacular! Maria adores

258
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,887
The tears, it's that one wants to drink them, one wants to eat them, my delicacy.

259
00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:27,631
As a result of this quote, I found that lacrifagy actually exists.

260
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:31,316
Lacrifagia! What a beautiful word! And this made me think

261
00:16:31,536 --> 00:16:34,600
in a movie that I used to watch with my friend Andrea over and over again,

262
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,604
over and over again, over and over again, when we were little, what is this about

263
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41,789
John Waters' Crybaby. And there is a moment when ovaries,

264
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:42,430
in which they suck...

265
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:48,699
Lick of tears. Quite a community of veguinas that of the Lick.

266
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:51,443
of tears, the truth. All of them. That's the truth.

267
00:16:52,485 --> 00:16:56,250
But anyway, going back to Maria de Oignis,

268
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,815
Well, it's not that we don't know how to pronounce their last name, we would have to look it up. But anyway,

269
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:03,398
Maria actually adored herself very much and that's why

270
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:06,940
we absolutely love it. Because we always talk about how people

271
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,482
From the Baroque they lived immersed in self-promotion.

272
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:14,484
unstoppable. And that is something that quite entices us. But it's just that the medieval mystics,

273
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:18,808
that always have their little star appearances in the episodes when we sin

274
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:23,050
of anachronisms, since medieval mystics were not lacking in self-promotion.

275
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:26,333
And Maria, among all of them, was super specialized.

276
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:30,335
because I'm going to detach myself from crying just for a moment because it seems like an anecdote to me.

277
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,656
that is absolutely worth it. When Maria realizes that the

278
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:37,218
relic industry was beginning to grow, she made sure to start

279
00:17:37,238 --> 00:17:40,880
to fragment before dying in order to pave the way in such a manner that

280
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,121
after his death, ensure that his relics remained.

281
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:47,503
Then, very cleverly, she pulled out several strands of

282
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:51,365
hair that he distributed among the sick in his area so that they could heal

283
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:55,147
and according to his hagiographer, who was named Thomas of Cantimpré,

284
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:59,689
We are assuming that these people were speaking in French, we are not entirely sure.

285
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:03,590
Maria's strands of hair worked perfectly.

286
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:07,692
He has many miracle stories, apart from this one about the lock of hair.

287
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:10,934
hair that I love, but I'm going to tell you, I'm going to

288
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:13,935
Tell me Carmen, which is my favorite before returning to tears.

289
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:19,160
She, of course, was fascinated by the possibility of her body being fragmented.

290
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,062
after she died, as it also put some pressure on her,

291
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:25,544
logically. So, after seeing the prior one day

292
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:29,227
from their community, pulling teeth from a corpse to keep them.

293
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:32,930
the relics, let's not forget all this delirium, She told him

294
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,552
She pursued him super insistently, begging him to please not do that to her. Please.

295
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:39,214
When I die, do not pull out my teeth.

296
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:43,377
The poor girl is like please not me. And when

297
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,680
The very mischievous prior dies, because Maria had died in the odor of sanctity.

298
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,743
she tries to tear them off but she miraculously afterwards

299
00:18:50,783 --> 00:18:53,625
even in death she manages to keep her jaw tightly shut,

300
00:18:53,845 --> 00:18:57,047
hermetic And only when the prior shows his astonishment in plan,

301
00:18:57,247 --> 00:19:00,368
Oh my God, this is a miracle, then she relaxes her jaw and allows him.

302
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:04,050
pull out some little teeth. How does that leave you? Well, perplexed,

303
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,591
as always with all these perplexed women. I can understand her, it's like,

304
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,233
don't do that to me. No, of course, don't pull out my teeth. The thing about going

305
00:19:11,293 --> 00:19:14,734
Fragmenting yourself into relics even before dying with the industry afterwards.

306
00:19:14,794 --> 00:19:18,336
I find it quite spectacular. Which parts of your body do you...

307
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:21,598
would you detach in life? In other words, what would you turn into relics? I, as

308
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:25,401
Maria, anything that wouldn't violate anything painful or that wouldn't violate anyone.

309
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:28,603
my body, that is, it can be nails or hair. Well, I am the

310
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:31,384
hair too, which is also a very nineteenth-century thing. I think this has already been

311
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:34,947
We have said in some episode, is that we think too much about relics.

312
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:38,489
But not the nails, because they give me a little bit of

313
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:41,731
Huge disgust. Nails give quite a disgust.

314
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:45,813
Do you know what I thought? Look, there is one thing that I would indeed give up in life. What are you going to do?

315
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:49,015
to say? If I were obliged to provide a

316
00:19:49,075 --> 00:19:51,976
relic market around my body, which is not going to happen.

317
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:54,897
It can happen. I'm telling you already, but...

318
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:59,780
It's just that I really like ribs as a relic. And you can

319
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,861
remove, in fact, there are women who have removed themselves. Marilyn Manson who was said to

320
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:06,403
she had removed them in order to perform fellatio on herself.

321
00:20:07,403 --> 00:20:11,505
That was circulating when I was a teenager. I'm very sorry. This information was circulating.

322
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,867
when I was young. I apologize. I was going to say that there were actresses who

323
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:17,167
they took them off, but... Juana...

324
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:22,529
Sorry. Poor. We ask for a lot of forgiveness, especially to our dearest.

325
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:25,930
Little girl from the 12th century. Well, so you can have a prettier image in

326
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,671
around the ribs. that the ribs hurt me.

327
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,893
like, because I like them in themselves, like the idea of a rib to me

328
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:36,714
like, but it's just that rib reliquaries tend to be pretty,

329
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:40,296
They are usually very beautiful. That's true, the rib reliquaries are very beautiful.

330
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:44,698
Ugh, that was really tough. I deeply apologize to all our listeners.

331
00:20:44,998 --> 00:20:47,899
Well, we return to Maria. We return to Maria.

332
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:51,821
It's that she, in addition to describing, well, part of this entire industry of relics that

333
00:20:51,861 --> 00:20:54,752
she had in mind, with the crying,

334
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:58,294
forces you to see it this way, what else

335
00:20:58,354 --> 00:21:01,176
Convinces you that bursting into tears is the best thing you can do in your life.

336
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:06,218
And this makes me think, do you believe that crying actually provides relief? I mean,

337
00:21:06,238 --> 00:21:09,880
which is like a healing potion, as I already said, that leaves your soul calm,

338
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,381
with the sweetest anointing, and that you feel much better afterwards.

339
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:16,703
from having cried. Absolutely, yes, you're left like a baby. I think it's quite...

340
00:21:16,723 --> 00:21:20,505
What is a balm. Absolutely a healing potion. Do you believe?

341
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:24,377
what not? Not necessarily, I think that

342
00:21:24,437 --> 00:21:29,322
It could be worse. I think you can enter into a...

343
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:32,625
I don't see it clearly. But well, Maria's crying,

344
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:36,449
like that of so many medieval mystics, what it achieves is to convert

345
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:40,213
the pain into joy. That is wonderful. And not

346
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:43,856
it is a cry born from regret for one's own sins,

347
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:46,579
it is not because of the tears, it is not.

348
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:50,980
but a cry achieved through meditation on the suffering of Christ and

349
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,541
of the Virgin throughout all that happened on Good Friday.

350
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:57,762
We, as medievalists, you already know this, have nothing.

351
00:21:58,322 --> 00:22:02,063
but all of this is wonderfully explained by Rebeca San Martín Bastida, in a

352
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:05,424
Very cool book about María de Santo Domingo, whom we will talk about later.

353
00:22:05,444 --> 00:22:08,925
In addition, Rebeca San Martín Bastida has directed several projects.

354
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:10,805
of research on visionary women.

355
00:22:13,846 --> 00:22:17,468
So, returning to them, within the framework of this spirituality

356
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:20,349
very somatic medieval, she explains this,

357
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,531
It was understood that when holiness dwelt in the body, it did so in form.

358
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:27,213
of rivers, we love this, like blood or the

359
00:22:27,273 --> 00:22:30,715
tears. That's why crying was a highly prized geographical mark,

360
00:22:31,055 --> 00:22:34,497
a hint of divine presence achieved through assumption

361
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:37,935
the pains, the pain of Christ. In other words, it was empathy.

362
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:41,437
unleashed, a delirium of mirror neurons, precious tears.

363
00:22:41,457 --> 00:22:44,559
And there were many mystics with tears of holiness. Let's remember some of them.

364
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:47,860
Lists, we love lists. Let's list names. Beatriz of Nazareth,

365
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,242
She was crying non-stop, apparently due to some issues with her companions.

366
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:54,404
very understanding about the crying. Poor thing. Of course, then,

367
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:58,506
another name that I don't know how to pronounce, Beatriz de Gnaché,

368
00:22:58,526 --> 00:23:01,807
for example. Is this her name? Yes, this is her name. She had

369
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,829
such a tearful devotion, that this amuses me a lot,

370
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:08,711
she was on the verge of going blind from shedding so many tears. This was

371
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:12,193
every topic, going blind from crying. It can happen to us any day.

372
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:15,995
We are coming for you. Be careful. And then they worry.

373
00:23:16,056 --> 00:23:18,477
the listeners. No, no one should worry, we are very well.

374
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:24,580
I'm great. We're phenomenal. Catherine of Siena.

375
00:23:25,841 --> 00:23:29,803
She even devoted a small section of the dialogue she wrote to what

376
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:33,564
He called it the doctrine of tears. Well, it also has an exhortation,

377
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:36,786
an invitation to weeping, but the doctrine of tears is a little aside.

378
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:40,127
where she divides the tears into five categories. And to you, Ana,

379
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:43,549
that you love a certainty. What you love most in life. A handhold. What

380
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:46,490
more in life. I know that this idea of being able to categorize tears you

381
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,431
It's going to give quite a bit of relief, I know it.

382
00:23:50,244 --> 00:23:53,666
It's just that I know her so well that I know the next time she cries,

383
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,828
at least for a split second. I mean, it's not going to last that long,

384
00:23:56,888 --> 00:24:00,371
but for at least a second, you are going to distract the sorrow or the stress.

385
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:04,133
stopping and asking yourself what kind of crying is touching you that day.

386
00:24:04,153 --> 00:24:07,075
It's just that I know you. Of course, what seduces me the most in life is you.

387
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:10,737
a taxonomy. Having everything organized, classified. Well, then I'm a mess,

388
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:13,619
but conceptually I like taxonomies.

389
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:17,281
It may be that of all the lifebuoys you give me, which are infinite, all,

390
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:20,446
almost everyone, This may be the one I doubt the most in the months of

391
00:24:20,506 --> 00:24:23,912
confinement that remains for us. And when discouragement and tears come to me.

392
00:24:23,952 --> 00:24:27,744
like... What tears am I having now according to Catalina?

393
00:24:27,784 --> 00:24:31,407
Siena? But tell us, let's go to all the listeners, let's listen well.

394
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:34,770
the categories of the tears of Catherine of Siena. We can try them all,

395
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,474
absolutely all. A little classification trick to distance ourselves a bit.

396
00:24:38,514 --> 00:24:42,277
from the penalty at the same time as we analyze it almost from

397
00:24:42,377 --> 00:24:45,660
outside, like picking up sadness with tweezers and a scalpel. Thus,

398
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,062
Pay attention everyone. Four types, okay?

399
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:51,923
1. The tears of the wicked men of the world are

400
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:55,044
Tears of damnation. Tears of damnation, number one.

401
00:24:55,064 --> 00:24:57,584
Terrible. This is absolute desperation, doom.

402
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:01,845
Then there are those of fear, those who rise.

403
00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:04,806
from sin for fear of punishment and for fear they cry.

404
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:09,027
From fear, number two. These are a bit like crocodile tears. We're going to talk about that.

405
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:12,626
also speak. Those of whom, raised from sin,

406
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:15,887
They start to take a liking to me. And they cry sweetly and begin to serve me.

407
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:18,428
But as love is imperfect, so is crying.

408
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,349
Halfway there. And this is the wonderful one. This is for those who

409
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:37,251
they have achieved perfection in charity towards their neighbor,

410
00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:40,992
loving me without any self-interest. These cry and their

411
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:45,033
crying is perfect. It is the one of tears of sweetness, shed with

412
00:25:45,073 --> 00:25:47,954
Great softness. Tears of sweetness. Such a beauty.

413
00:25:48,535 --> 00:25:53,737
If you had to categorize your tears, let's take the paradigm

414
00:25:53,757 --> 00:25:57,658
from Catherine of Siena. If you had to categorize your tears, what would they be like?

415
00:25:57,668 --> 00:26:02,554
4 too.

416
00:26:05,035 --> 00:26:08,117
What would be my equivalent to the tears of damnation, the worst of all,

417
00:26:08,137 --> 00:26:12,039
would be self-fulfilling prophecies. You know this.

418
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:15,700
you know. It's a loop of things I don't want to happen,

419
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,982
but I delight in imagining that they pass and suffer and cry.

420
00:26:19,382 --> 00:26:23,307
Those are the worst. Second, well, from exhaustion. I believe that

421
00:26:23,508 --> 00:26:27,114
The ones here are to cry like babies from exhaustion. Absolute exhaustion.

422
00:26:27,154 --> 00:26:31,852
A bit of crocodile too, I believe. Then I have a

423
00:26:31,932 --> 00:26:36,817
third category which would be guilty tears.

424
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:40,220
Just like guilty pleasure, of tears. This is something that I believe that

425
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,064
I've never talked about it with you or anyone else. Well, now you're talking about it with

426
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:47,287
a lot of people in a way

427
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:50,691
deferred. Well, the thing is, something has been happening to me since I was little that embarrasses me quite a bit.

428
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:55,114
As if I hide, as if they infect me.

429
00:26:55,174 --> 00:26:58,596
people's tears of joy for things that

430
00:26:58,636 --> 00:27:01,358
They make me feel secondhand embarrassment.

431
00:27:01,438 --> 00:27:05,581
Not necessarily secondhand embarrassment, but yes. For example,

432
00:27:05,621 --> 00:27:09,264
a television program, a Celebrity

433
00:27:09,284 --> 00:27:12,726
Bake Off, which I don't care about at all and just skip over.

434
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:14,827
in front while my mother watches or something like that.

435
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:19,451
when someone wins and cries with emotion, it triggers me.

436
00:27:19,511 --> 00:27:23,354
as mirror neurons, I believe, and even if not, I mean, it's just that a

437
00:27:23,394 --> 00:27:26,577
a real emotional level, I'm not feeling anything there,

438
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:30,520
But aunt, you can see my tears. They are like echoes. They are like echoes.

439
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,063
It's very embarrassing. Embarrassing name, isn't it, Carmen?

440
00:27:34,103 --> 00:27:37,287
Yes, I don't like those. And then there are,

441
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:41,775
like those of Catherine of Siena, Tears of sweetness,

442
00:27:41,835 --> 00:27:45,261
because I like them. As of goodness, as of joy, which also the

443
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:48,287
I have. Those are the best. Those are wonderful. And you?

444
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,103
Let's see, I believe, my first tears are actually very

445
00:27:53,143 --> 00:27:56,925
in tune with your self-fulfilled prophecies and they are like invented catastrophes,

446
00:27:56,945 --> 00:28:00,347
that it's the same thing. It's just that we love that. Self-fulfilling prophecies, invented catastrophes,

447
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:04,270
those are the worst, they are awful and are the most

448
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:08,513
are abundant in this small recording studio that we are integrating

449
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:12,135
only Carmen and I, are the ones that are most abundant. Then, I have been suspecting

450
00:28:12,175 --> 00:28:15,538
some tears, which are hormonal tears fueled by premenstrual syndrome.

451
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:19,801
Those are there, without a doubt. Not every month, but with some frequency.

452
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:24,545
The third category, undoubtedly, is like exhaustion and distress, but a very physical thing.

453
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:28,268
like you just can't take it anymore. And this had happened to me several times before, but about

454
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:31,330
all this year, which are some colossal levels of fatigue.

455
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:37,535
And tears of vulnerability, like a baby's.

456
00:28:38,861 --> 00:28:42,504
Well, I've been left thinking

457
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:46,708
in this. Catherine of Siena and we ourselves just finished developing.

458
00:28:46,928 --> 00:28:50,251
our categorization of crying based on the emotions that they

459
00:28:50,331 --> 00:28:53,654
move. But it's just that I've discovered that at the highest level.

460
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:57,098
Purely material, in reality there are three types of tears.

461
00:28:57,658 --> 00:29:01,642
Let's see, we're going to pretend to be little doctors. Now we are researchers.

462
00:29:02,062 --> 00:29:05,746
really. One is the basal ones,

463
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:09,749
I think they are called basal, which is like the ones we always have.

464
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:13,173
that are dedicated to constantly lubricating the eye. Then there are the

465
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:16,696
irritating, which despite their name, actually fulfill

466
00:29:17,117 --> 00:29:20,320
a function, that of relieving irritations, because when something gets into you

467
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,623
the eye, whatever it is. And then there are the psychogenic ones,

468
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,986
that they are purely emotional. And the strong thing is

469
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:30,168
that these three types of tears are different

470
00:29:30,188 --> 00:29:33,591
at the composition level. Because emotional tears are much

471
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:37,374
richer in proteins. We cry proteins away. I'm imagining Carmen.

472
00:29:37,414 --> 00:29:41,077
at his house with the glasses and the computer on Wikipedia. Tears.

473
00:29:42,143 --> 00:29:45,704
Types of tears? It's like we cry proteins.

474
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,586
And I found it extremely funny to come across it. Yeah, the idea of crying proteins of sadness is amazing.

475
00:29:49,686 --> 00:29:52,827
I find myself thinking again here, I am thinking a lot about Marta López Álamo today.

476
00:29:54,367 --> 00:29:57,188
and I'm thinking that she is all protein shake,

477
00:29:57,288 --> 00:30:00,850
should cry... Condensed protein. But well, they weren't going so

478
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:04,151
then all these visionaries were misguided when they thought

479
00:30:04,191 --> 00:30:07,072
in tears in terms of food. Look, says Catalina.

480
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:10,622
In feeling, eternal God, the eye begins to shed.

481
00:30:10,702 --> 00:30:14,270
tears of sweetness, which are the milk that nourishes my soul with truth.

482
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:17,858
patience. They are a balm that gives off a scent of sweetness.

483
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,784
Let's see if I can explain this, because it is

484
00:30:22,844 --> 00:30:26,567
a quite fantastic fluid economy, but very convoluted.

485
00:30:27,248 --> 00:30:29,730
In certain medical treaties of the time,

486
00:30:30,971 --> 00:30:34,355
Contemporaries of Catalina explain that breasts produce

487
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:38,198
the milk from warm and refined blood, and that by

488
00:30:38,218 --> 00:30:41,561
That's why the breasts were close to the heart. An unbeatable logic.

489
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:46,463
The eyes, in turn, pour a type of milk, nourishing the soul, which resides.

490
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:49,464
the heart, which in turn produces blood, which turns into milk.

491
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:53,585
Well, and so in an infinite circulation of nutritious whining. It's a little confusing and

492
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:57,125
I don't know very reliable. The whole thing excites me a lot.

493
00:30:57,185 --> 00:31:01,126
Carmen and I have talked a lot about this since we met, because we learned it.

494
00:31:01,186 --> 00:31:04,327
more or less at the same time. And it excites us.

495
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:07,348
I really love this idea of the fluid economy. Additionally, Carmen, I love that you...

496
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:11,209
you have painted it as a rather sublime and poetic process, which is how we are.

497
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:15,070
We always imagine it. But I have been delving a little more into treaties.

498
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:18,031
doctors of that time and I'm afraid that was not necessarily the case.

499
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:22,332
Although I anticipate that yes, it is equally fascinating, because our most favorite centuries

500
00:31:22,372 --> 00:31:25,893
from history never let us down.

501
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:29,394
I think we have talked about this in many episodes here and there,

502
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,935
but it is always worth remembering that the theory of humors governs medicine.

503
00:31:32,995 --> 00:31:36,616
Renaissance and Baroque until well into the 17th century. All this

504
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:40,698
The fantasy of humors prevails until the end of the 17th century and this

505
00:31:40,718 --> 00:31:44,462
it suits us perfectly because it was, as Carmen was saying,

506
00:31:44,522 --> 00:31:47,856
an absolute fantasy. I was the other day preparing

507
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:51,257
this episode reading a book that, as very informative,

508
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:54,338
although it's not one of those books you'd call beach reading.

509
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:57,999
The book was called Telling Tears in Renaissance England. In other words,

510
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:02,300
like tears in Renaissance England. To the

511
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,641
brave. Well, I discovered a guy named Timothy Bright, who was a

512
00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:10,883
Cambridge doctor, and in 1586 he writes a treatise on melancholy where

513
00:32:10,944 --> 00:32:13,866
it explains what tears are and why we cry. I have translated it myself,

514
00:32:13,886 --> 00:32:17,509
I have usurped you as a translator. And then he says...

515
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:21,632
The substance of tears is the excremental moisture of the brain.

516
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:25,415
not contained in the veins. That's why they resemble the color of urine.

517
00:32:25,796 --> 00:32:29,078
They get their color from the thinnest part of the blood and that's why they appear.

518
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:31,561
yellow. But, I mean, this person...

519
00:32:32,521 --> 00:32:35,544
Timothy was crying yellow. Timothy was not okay.

520
00:32:36,024 --> 00:32:39,085
Timothy was in bad shape. Imagine a

521
00:32:39,145 --> 00:32:43,147
pale Englishman in the 16th century, imagine. A pale Englishman.

522
00:32:43,187 --> 00:32:45,467
Crying yellow is indeed a huge disgust.

523
00:32:46,348 --> 00:32:49,909
And these medical treaties, robbing the heart of all its poetic beauty.

524
00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:53,130
from the nuns to focus everything on the brain, damn them.

525
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,931
But everything is pretty much on track, because as you were saying, both the milk

526
00:32:56,991 --> 00:33:01,173
as the tears were refined blood, or so it was understood. And Timothy

527
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:04,514
Bright clings to that to explain to you that they do not come out directly from

528
00:33:04,554 --> 00:33:07,775
the veins, the tears, but they come from the veins,

529
00:33:07,795 --> 00:33:11,037
The refined blood passes through the brain or the heart.

530
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:14,478
then you can choose, and thus they drive the movement of these organs.

531
00:33:14,498 --> 00:33:18,081
Ana is moving her hands a lot, as if making a very realistic diagram of

532
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:21,243
all of this that is happening. It has been very hard for me to try to understand this.

533
00:33:21,903 --> 00:33:25,305
That is to say, according to these 16th-century doctors, tears had a lot.

534
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:28,467
related to the movement of the brain. A French doctor,

535
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:32,159
Logan Hubert, writes in 1579

536
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:35,711
a more detailed explanation, which I have also translated and am also going to read to you.

537
00:33:36,984 --> 00:33:40,487
Among all animals, humans, because they have the most developed brain.

538
00:33:40,547 --> 00:33:44,209
large in proportion to their body and weight, they are the ones who possess the most.

539
00:33:44,349 --> 00:33:47,752
these excretions that we call tears, which come out of the eyes,

540
00:33:47,852 --> 00:33:51,474
the nose, the mouth, and the ears. This is not because the brain is cold,

541
00:33:51,935 --> 00:33:55,277
but because it needs large amounts of blood to procreate.

542
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:58,740
large amount of fluids that are necessary for their main functions.

543
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,642
And as in all this blood there is very little that can serve as food for

544
00:34:02,682 --> 00:34:06,043
the brain, there is a lot that is called excrement.

545
00:34:06,824 --> 00:34:10,226
And that's why we shouldn't be surprised if when the brain is compressed

546
00:34:10,545 --> 00:34:13,687
expels large amounts of tears. That is,

547
00:34:13,766 --> 00:34:17,168
In summary, tears are what remains when you set aside the sanguine humor.

548
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,590
in motion and as it is useless for anyone, expel it.

549
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:24,612
Let's see if maybe we cry so much here because our brains are compressed.

550
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:28,335
Let's see, we have it compressed. Don't

551
00:34:28,395 --> 00:34:32,206
doesn't fit at all. It's just that also this

552
00:34:32,226 --> 00:34:36,027
it made me think of Concha, because in the pet episode we talked about

553
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:40,271
Concha and how bad, then many listeners asked and we have not

554
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:44,353
said nothing. Concha is improving, she is better,

555
00:34:44,414 --> 00:34:48,016
but his brain is compressed precisely, he has a very big brain and a little head.

556
00:34:48,056 --> 00:34:50,757
very small because it is inflamed, in short.

557
00:34:51,638 --> 00:34:55,159
Well, I'm going to surprise you with something. Tell me, what a thrill. Yes,

558
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:58,780
because of course, all of this, all this economy

559
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,141
of fluids, of the tears that come from the brain, of the blood,

560
00:35:02,221 --> 00:35:05,782
Blablabla, excrement and all this humoral stuff.

561
00:35:05,822 --> 00:35:09,643
with the crying, it made me think, you know, of a poem

562
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:13,745
from Sor Juana. Sor Juana! That Sor Juana is

563
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:17,548
a matter that we have very pending.

564
00:35:17,728 --> 00:35:21,150
Do not think, dear listeners, that we do not think about Sor Juana and that we have not done

565
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:25,092
an episode of Sor Juana. It is a burden that we have on

566
00:35:25,192 --> 00:35:28,394
us. But then we mention her all the time, very much to

567
00:35:28,434 --> 00:35:31,756
often. Yes, but he doesn't have his episode. He doesn't have his episode.

568
00:35:31,836 --> 00:35:35,599
but he will have it. It seems very bold to us.

569
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:41,204
to confront an episode of Sor Juana. After having completed a four-seminar course.

570
00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:44,466
months, three hours a week, only about Sor Juana, it seems to us

571
00:35:44,606 --> 00:35:46,428
bold. Precisely for that reason.

572
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:50,511
And very bold is what I am going to do now, which is to read this poem.

573
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:54,134
Are you going to recite? A sonnet. I'm going to recline. I'm not.

574
00:35:54,174 --> 00:35:57,757
I know how to recite this. I ask for forgiveness, but well. It's a sonnet.

575
00:36:00,317 --> 00:36:03,998
It is a sonnet in which the discourse inevitably unfolds.

576
00:36:04,058 --> 00:36:07,779
crying in the sight of a loved one. This happens. Sometimes you see

577
00:36:07,819 --> 00:36:11,100
to whom you love and it makes you cry. We also have a very pending one.

578
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,581
episode about love. That it must be done now, now is the time. Now is

579
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:18,121
the moment, it's true. Well this

580
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:20,362
It's very good, look, listen to me. Come on, let's see, I listen, I recline.

581
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,044
Command, heal, that without crying, I may come to see your eyes, from what

582
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:30,107
which I suspect that ignoring the cause is what has made you

583
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:33,470
wanting me to undertake such a conquest. Love,

584
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:37,333
Lady, without any resistance from me, your broken heart is on fire.

585
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:41,537
how it makes the blood boil there in the chest, passions vaporize

586
00:36:41,718 --> 00:36:46,081
by sight. Then my eyes seek your presence, which is the center.

587
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:50,184
they judge your sweet charm, and when my attention reveres you,

588
00:36:50,204 --> 00:36:53,706
The visual rays, meanwhile, as there may be

589
00:36:53,786 --> 00:36:57,709
in your snow resistance, what came out as steam turns into tears.

590
00:36:58,143 --> 00:37:01,746
Sor Juana, it's just that Sor Juana takes me to states of sublimation.

591
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:06,890
Please, go back 15 seconds and listen to it again.

592
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,373
It's spectacular, I didn't know this sonnet. It's wonderful,

593
00:37:10,393 --> 00:37:13,116
she has read all the treaties she has wanted to, she has

594
00:37:13,136 --> 00:37:16,378
learned in medical treaties how this humor thing works,

595
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:19,821
the crying, and suddenly it makes you a little love sonnet with this.

596
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:23,525
I also tell you the game that Sor Juana gave her, of moods.

597
00:37:23,585 --> 00:37:26,969
Well, she made the most of it. She was into recycling.

598
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,554
In conclusion, we will return to Sor Juana.

599
00:37:31,574 --> 00:37:35,338
Yes, we will return to Sor Juana. I loved it. It's very beautiful. It has

600
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:39,623
left as in a balm. It's like a sweet potion to listen to you.

601
00:37:39,663 --> 00:37:42,626
recite Sor Juana. The thing about vaporizing ardors through sight.

602
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:44,790
Love is about leaving you!

603
00:37:55,335 --> 00:37:58,456
With this poetic precision. Stop talking about your yellow tears.

604
00:37:58,796 --> 00:38:02,717
Please. In the end, with all this understood crying.

605
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:07,098
as circularity, as something cyclical and even almost as a dietary habit,

606
00:38:07,438 --> 00:38:12,119
It is very difficult not to think about the possibility of crying as a dangerously practice.

607
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,721
addictive. In fact, so addictive and

608
00:38:15,741 --> 00:38:19,545
It turns out that crying has been a stress reliever in Japan in recent years.

609
00:38:19,585 --> 00:38:21,286
Various companies have appeared.

610
00:38:23,388 --> 00:38:27,051
Suddenly Japan. We have made a geographical tour in this.

611
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:30,214
episode in what we have and what remains. Well in Japan,

612
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:33,697
Of course, it is characterized by being a society that is very stoic, very introverted,

613
00:38:34,038 --> 00:38:37,060
another, in recent years various companies have emerged that on one hand or another,

614
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,623
Others have made crying their business, they have capitalized on tears.

615
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:44,787
There is a company called Ikemeseo Danshi,

616
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:48,650
what it does is that it makes you

617
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,933
carries... I love how they say it in English, they call it handsome weeping.

618
00:38:51,973 --> 00:38:55,856
boys, or rather, like handsome crybabies, that you

619
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:59,919
they put videos, they go to your company... Imagine that we are in the library,

620
00:38:59,939 --> 00:39:03,242
not because we don't go, because we work from home, but suppose we are at the

621
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:06,965
library and they take us to some boys

622
00:39:07,085 --> 00:39:10,547
Handsome people who what they do is show you videos that make you cry.

623
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:12,848
and then they dry your tears.

624
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:17,711
Strong. They don't drink them or anything else. No, they don't drink them, they give them to you.

625
00:39:17,751 --> 00:39:21,273
they dry and that's it. Something more refined is the project of a former high school teacher.

626
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:24,835
that, restless and worried about the lack of tears in society

627
00:39:24,955 --> 00:39:28,817
Japanese and due to work exhaustion, has created

628
00:39:28,898 --> 00:39:33,340
many places that are designed for crying. The most famous one is called Tears.

629
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,506
and Travel Café. And the slogan says

630
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,617
that it is an invitation for those who want to cry, those who don't.

631
00:39:42,677 --> 00:39:46,324
manage to cry and those who are stressed and tired of the

632
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:50,248
life. But of course, it's not a charity, because everything

633
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:53,610
This consists of capitalizing on tears, which of course, if the tears.

634
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,332
they are free, it's like something that comes naturally to you that they are free,

635
00:39:56,372 --> 00:39:58,553
but not here, because in a very disturbing way,

636
00:39:59,093 --> 00:40:02,315
in the promotion of this coffee,

637
00:40:03,496 --> 00:40:06,718
you pay for the amount you cry, which I'm not quite sure what it refers to,

638
00:40:06,918 --> 00:40:10,680
But I can tell you, Carmen, that a manicure with an added bout of crying.

639
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,462
it's 166 dollars. There is a documentary about all this, which went to Sundance and

640
00:40:14,482 --> 00:40:17,943
everything, I won't remember the title, but there is a documentary that tracks all the

641
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:20,764
Story of these cafes to cry over. But how intense.

642
00:40:21,284 --> 00:40:24,685
The thing about the manicure... 166 dollars is not cheap at all.

643
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:27,986
No, it's not cheap. Crying doesn't make it cheap.

644
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:31,968
It is not. It seems very strong to me. In fact, in Madrid.

645
00:40:31,988 --> 00:40:35,300
There was one thing I think lasted three days.

646
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:38,984
Madrid is not Japan. One, two, and three. But I think it was free.

647
00:40:39,344 --> 00:40:42,207
because it was actually a kind of promotion for something, I guess.

648
00:40:42,787 --> 00:40:46,991
But it was called The Crying Place, which is a terrible name.

649
00:40:47,031 --> 00:40:50,574
Much better the thing about Akane and the thing about Hanson Weeping Boys.

650
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,997
But they put something, I think it was malasaña, obviously.

651
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:58,321
And it was like a place, it was called The Crying Place, and you would go there.

652
00:40:58,341 --> 00:41:02,405
and everything was decorated with very bright colors and there was

653
00:41:02,685 --> 00:41:06,168
a bathtub full of little balls and you could

654
00:41:06,248 --> 00:41:09,732
putting it there in that bathtub very illuminated with spotlights, because by

655
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:13,175
why not cry like that, and you could pick up fake phones.

656
00:41:14,256 --> 00:41:18,058
And above each phone, to call from the bathtub, supposedly crying,

657
00:41:18,118 --> 00:41:20,981
it will be the intention, above each phone it said, well,

658
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:25,044
mom, pet. Ugh, how awful. Look, it upset me even more.

659
00:41:25,104 --> 00:41:28,366
the stomach that Timothy's yellow excremental tears

660
00:41:28,406 --> 00:41:30,348
Bright. We are going to abandon this. We are going to leave it.

661
00:41:31,328 --> 00:41:35,452
Tear, the language

662
00:41:35,632 --> 00:41:38,294
Silent of your sorrow.

663
00:41:38,314 --> 00:41:39,074
Tear,

664
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:49,634
Truly, as José José says, tears are

665
00:41:49,694 --> 00:41:53,155
a bit of a wildcard for everything, in other words, like an absolute blessing, actually, that for

666
00:41:53,235 --> 00:41:56,695
everything is worth it. Well, don't believe it, not always, because if all these

667
00:41:56,856 --> 00:42:00,416
medieval mystics we were talking about are something like the

668
00:42:00,496 --> 00:42:04,077
pioneers of crying, at the height of our most favorite centuries of

669
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:06,838
the story already... Let's get there, I mean, we are already late.

670
00:42:07,898 --> 00:42:11,982
Well, at this point, women's tears are no longer celebrated so much.

671
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:15,525
unequivocally as a gift and begin to scrutinize themselves

672
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:19,950
with magnifying glass. Already at the beginning of the 15th century, in fact, the poor...

673
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,373
How would you say this name? Marjorie Kemp. We have serious

674
00:42:23,433 --> 00:42:27,036
problems today with the medieval mystics of Northern Europe. They elude us.

675
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:30,859
much the pronunciation of their names. Help. Well, she stays.

676
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,221
without being canonized as a saint of the church, partly due to her weeping, because she

677
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:37,363
considers it exaggerated. Because another thing we are going to see

678
00:42:37,383 --> 00:42:40,425
Today is about the acceptance of crying, so like today in reality,

679
00:42:40,745 --> 00:42:44,267
It seems to be a matter of degree. In other words, well, it doesn't matter.

680
00:42:44,347 --> 00:42:48,149
But well, we will say it later. In her own spiritual autobiography, she herself

681
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:51,730
she recounts her own crying when she feels hopelessly moved by

682
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:54,192
certain music, by images or by thoughts.

683
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:59,202
And he also can't stop crying at the sight of a pietà. And the

684
00:42:59,262 --> 00:43:03,065
The problem is that she doesn't shed four little tears.

685
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:07,148
It's like a super loud sob, a complaint with

686
00:43:07,228 --> 00:43:11,211
contortions, excessive, and I suppose adds

687
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:14,854
in addition, a waterfall of snot to that economy of tears. In other words,

688
00:43:14,874 --> 00:43:17,837
Marjorie Kempe really cries, as one should cry.

689
00:43:18,457 --> 00:43:22,418
Well, she recounts in one of her chapters that a monk is

690
00:43:22,478 --> 00:43:25,939
Extremely stubborn, he is obsessed with his crying. He gets it into his head.

691
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:29,119
the crying. A friar friend? No, obviously he was not a friend.

692
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:35,020
Carmen knows that this friar was not a friend of Marguerite.

693
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,241
Kempe. No, because he does nothing but condemn their tears. And notice

694
00:43:39,261 --> 00:43:42,342
what he ends up telling him. One day, suddenly this man tells him.

695
00:43:42,402 --> 00:43:45,943
says woman. Also, woman. That is, the vocative,

696
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:47,343
woman. The worst form of address.

697
00:43:48,748 --> 00:43:52,270
Woman, it has been a long time since Jesus died.

698
00:43:53,011 --> 00:43:56,493
Super page-turner! Get over it! But of course,

699
00:43:56,693 --> 00:44:00,575
Estefania didn't know anything because she knew, and anyone who cries a

700
00:44:00,635 --> 00:44:03,897
a little bit of truth he knows, that crying is many times,

701
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:07,919
if not in all actually, an absolute surrender and abandonment

702
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,922
to the asynchrony. Tears are born from a very powerful meditative exercise.

703
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:16,644
that leads you to feel like present agonies of the past O

704
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:19,505
above all, potential future misfortunes, we know that.

705
00:44:20,506 --> 00:44:24,027
The fact is that due to her exaggerated crying, we do not have Marjorie in the list of saints.

706
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:28,328
Poor thing, I feel so much pity that this exceptional Yoricka,

707
00:44:28,928 --> 00:44:31,869
with which we currently feel a lot of empathy, has not reached the list of saints.

708
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:35,070
Someday we have to make an episode about saints and holy people who enter into the

709
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:38,751
saint's day and then they take them out because it seems to me an incredible impudence

710
00:44:38,811 --> 00:44:41,432
all those snubs. And it happened to Saint Valentine in 1969, they removed him from the list of saints.

711
00:44:44,293 --> 00:44:47,795
Carmen, I have a question for you. Today I am taking up a lot of your time.

712
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:51,117
papers because you tend to be like that of the interview questions of

713
00:44:51,157 --> 00:44:54,098
the TV and the translations, so I'm kind of stealing your role a bit.

714
00:44:54,138 --> 00:44:58,600
But since they are characters, we can exchange them. Today I have sent him

715
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,362
an audio to a listener who is already like a friend because she has been there all her life.

716
00:45:01,382 --> 00:45:02,683
I haven't heard it, I've seen everything and I haven't heard it. I have

717
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:04,563
I sent an audio and I said hello I am Ana and he says but of course

718
00:45:04,604 --> 00:45:07,985
that you are Ana, in other words, I recognize your voice, you are like friends.

719
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:11,848
But I believe that the voices know us well, but what I doubt is

720
00:45:11,908 --> 00:45:14,372
Identify the aspect of each voice.

721
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:18,119
That could be, because we hide our little faces a lot.

722
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,207
Carmen, here's my question. Do you think Our Saint Teresa cried?

723
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,623
Oh, let's see, knowing her, I don't think she would deprive herself of absolutely anything.

724
00:45:27,703 --> 00:45:31,266
And if there was a gift of tears, I don't think she would give it up.

725
00:45:31,286 --> 00:45:34,569
to that. But of course, on the other hand, I think about the

726
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:38,492
episode we recorded about Santa Teresa and the friends

727
00:45:38,512 --> 00:45:41,895
and the charismatic resistance and the tyranny of welfare and

728
00:45:41,935 --> 00:45:45,758
that perpetual Opusina smile that she asked for,

729
00:45:45,798 --> 00:45:49,340
By the way, our Saint Teresa has nothing to do with Opus.

730
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,901
No, nothing like that. Of course, you will have to listen to that episode to

731
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:56,522
know exactly what we were saying. But the thing is, I'm taking advantage now that it has come out.

732
00:45:56,562 --> 00:46:00,383
Opus to say that EPSA, on the podcast of

733
00:46:00,463 --> 00:46:03,844
EPSA, they made a wonderful episode about

734
00:46:03,864 --> 00:46:07,365
the Opus that we highly recommend. It is recommended, it is recommended.

735
00:46:08,006 --> 00:46:11,507
Well, but that makes me think that of course, on the other hand, not her.

736
00:46:11,547 --> 00:46:15,230
I see her crying, I don't see her. No, because we already know,

737
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:18,334
in that episode that we dedicated to Santa Teresa and the Friends,

738
00:46:18,754 --> 00:46:22,619
We know that she greatly avoided fussiness and hooded nuns.

739
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,143
as she called them. But despite that, despite everything.

740
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:29,768
this fleeing from hooded nuns and crying, their writings are

741
00:46:29,968 --> 00:46:33,892
soaked in tears of all kinds. But, of course, Saint Teresa,

742
00:46:33,952 --> 00:46:37,216
above all, she was extremely smart and knew very well that some

743
00:46:37,296 --> 00:46:41,280
Tears were welcome and fit well into the regulatory apparatus.

744
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,763
Orthodox and others, not so much. So,

745
00:46:44,823 --> 00:46:49,287
like Catherine of Siena and like us now, it has a tearful typology.

746
00:46:49,528 --> 00:46:53,108
quite clear. For example, she talks about the

747
00:46:53,128 --> 00:46:56,291
that they call true tears, which she associates with the gift of tears,

748
00:46:57,612 --> 00:47:01,475
just like Maria, just like Catherine of Siena, she begins to experience from super

749
00:47:01,495 --> 00:47:05,198
young girl. When the third alphabet falls into her hands

750
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:08,480
spiritual of a Franciscan, Francisco de Osuna, which is a little book that goes

751
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:12,143
to mark all her theological training, she picks up the book,

752
00:47:12,203 --> 00:47:14,505
One day, she gives it to her uncle, then she is there, she is very young,

753
00:47:14,545 --> 00:47:18,045
Grab the book and in the book of life it tells you to bother me a lot with

754
00:47:18,105 --> 00:47:21,529
him, with the book, and I decided to follow that path with all

755
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:24,773
my strength. And as the Lord had already given me the gift of tears and

756
00:47:24,993 --> 00:47:28,317
I liked to read, I began to have moments of solitude and to confess myself.

757
00:47:28,337 --> 00:47:33,423
often and start that path having that book as a teacher. Do you?

758
00:47:33,443 --> 00:47:34,865
Which book would give you the gift of tears?

759
00:47:36,572 --> 00:47:39,954
Well, I'm leaving directly.

760
00:47:39,974 --> 00:47:43,256
to 19th century novellas. We love 19th century novellas. It's just that we

761
00:47:43,316 --> 00:47:45,758
They like it a lot and are very much about granting a gift of tears.

762
00:47:46,378 --> 00:47:49,680
We have mentioned it here if not three times, then not at all.

763
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,802
We have talked about Doña Berta, from Aras Clarín.

764
00:47:54,023 --> 00:47:56,684
Lady Berta greatly induces the gift of tears.

765
00:47:58,285 --> 00:48:02,027
But I also believe, the book that I remember from when I was little.

766
00:48:02,107 --> 00:48:06,349
I had to read at school and cried a lot, it was also from the

767
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:09,211
19, it was Marianela. I haven't read Marianela, I have to read it.

768
00:48:09,311 --> 00:48:13,473
It's super tearful. It's very tearful, it's not the time. It's unbearably tearful.

769
00:48:13,733 --> 00:48:17,335
in conclusion. But yes, I cried a lot with that one, and you? Gosh,

770
00:48:17,355 --> 00:48:19,757
It's just that now you've said it, I hadn't thought about it, but now you've mentioned Doña Berta.

771
00:48:19,777 --> 00:48:23,399
and I remember crying at the end of Doña Berta, I mean, it's very moving.

772
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:27,000
pity. But well, we return to Santa Teresa. Because after

773
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,441
to tell you all this, which is already encountering this third spiritual alphabet and the

774
00:48:30,481 --> 00:48:34,462
gift of tears a little further on, our dearest Teresa explains to you

775
00:48:34,522 --> 00:48:37,682
with his delightful prose that true tears are

776
00:48:37,742 --> 00:48:40,963
consoling tears. And it tells you, tears are coming,

777
00:48:41,203 --> 00:48:44,945
Sometimes it seems like we force them out. Other times, the Lord.

778
00:48:45,026 --> 00:48:48,511
it seems to us she does it so we cannot resist. It seems to us

779
00:48:48,571 --> 00:48:51,916
His Majesty pays for that little care with such a great gift.

780
00:48:51,976 --> 00:48:55,361
How comforting it is for a soul to see that it weeps for such a great thing.

781
00:48:55,421 --> 00:48:58,085
Sir. And I am not surprised that he has plenty of reason to console himself.

782
00:48:58,346 --> 00:49:01,395
Indulge yourself there. Enjoy yourself there! Oh, how he used to write!

783
00:49:02,136 --> 00:49:05,277
She was the best. She also cries, and this gives me immense tenderness.

784
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:09,200
when she begins to have intellectual visions because she doesn't know what they are. She begins

785
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,082
to have visions, he gets very overwhelmed, he doesn't know what's happening to him, and of course,

786
00:49:13,202 --> 00:49:17,144
and she is distressed. And she says, I, being utterly ignorant that there could be such a thing.

787
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:21,226
vision, it gave me great fear at first and I did nothing but cry. It was a

788
00:49:21,246 --> 00:49:24,869
a bit like frustration. Of course, like not understanding what was happening to him and like

789
00:49:24,909 --> 00:49:28,531
that its mystical beginnings were beginnings from crying and suffering.

790
00:49:29,271 --> 00:49:32,312
Let's see, this is their own crying, but when there was crying around them,

791
00:49:32,432 --> 00:49:35,754
When was it other people who were crying? Because we already know that, that Teresa was the

792
00:49:35,814 --> 00:49:39,255
queen of the tyranny of welfare. No, of course, when they cry around her.

793
00:49:39,275 --> 00:49:42,756
She gives him a distrust that kills him. And no, it's like her tears,

794
00:49:42,776 --> 00:49:46,378
Yes, because she was very controlling. Her tears, yes, because she controls them.

795
00:49:46,898 --> 00:49:50,339
But of course, what scares Santa the most

796
00:49:50,399 --> 00:49:53,780
Teresa is the thin and melancholic complexions in her convents.

797
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,803
So, of course, the crying upsets him quite a bit.

798
00:49:58,023 --> 00:50:01,366
fear and, in fact, says, from a little moment, Santa Teresa audiobook,

799
00:50:01,426 --> 00:50:05,049
but he deserves it. He advises the priors of his convents.

800
00:50:05,249 --> 00:50:09,012
Also note that it usually causes the thin complexion of these sorrows,

801
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,975
especially if it is in tender people who cry for every little thing.

802
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:16,679
A thousand times they will make them understand that they cry for God, may it not be so. And still

803
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:20,302
It may happen that when a multitude of tears come, I mean, for a while,

804
00:50:20,322 --> 00:50:23,724
that every little word heard or thought about God cannot be resisted.

805
00:50:23,744 --> 00:50:27,327
to cry. to see if any humor has reached the heart that helps.

806
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:30,350
more than the love one has for God, which seemed to never end.

807
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:33,372
cry and, as they already understand that tears are good,

808
00:50:33,872 --> 00:50:37,135
they don't go hand in hand nor would they want to do anything else and they help when they can

809
00:50:37,195 --> 00:50:40,598
with them. They intend for the devil here to weaken them in such a way that

810
00:50:40,658 --> 00:50:43,920
"afterwards they may not be able to pray or keep their rule". Let's see, it's like, of course,

811
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:47,023
you believe that tears are a good thing and you just can't stop and in

812
00:50:47,063 --> 00:50:50,926
In reality, you are lost in melancholy. She didn't know how to relate well with discomfort.

813
00:50:51,226 --> 00:50:53,929
of the saint. She would not put up with us.

814
00:50:53,949 --> 00:50:56,331
Anyone who has listened to us for half a minute knows who we are,

815
00:50:56,651 --> 00:50:59,694
Precisely, tender people who cry over every little thing.

816
00:50:59,714 --> 00:51:03,317
It's not true, Carmen. We are very optimistic and cheerful people, but we are in

817
00:51:03,357 --> 00:51:07,241
an extremely delicate situation. Well,

818
00:51:07,601 --> 00:51:11,264
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. It's delicate. I am very optimistic.

819
00:51:11,385 --> 00:51:15,348
I am very optimistic, super. Normally?

820
00:51:15,408 --> 00:51:18,551
Normally? Of course he/she can't stand me anymore!

821
00:51:18,571 --> 00:51:23,456
No, it's not true. That's a lie. I always, and you know it. But it takes

822
00:51:23,556 --> 00:51:27,340
reason for this. The saint is right about this, she cannot.

823
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,024
to let oneself be carried away by the softness of tearful self-indulgence

824
00:51:31,104 --> 00:51:34,487
always. Sometimes, I don't scold you.

825
00:51:34,547 --> 00:51:37,811
but sometimes it's like I'm telling you, I'm telling you, let's see, what's wrong?

826
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:40,495
Tell me, if there's nothing wrong. Of course, I get a little

827
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:44,000
tyrant of well-being, actually being me as the meme is.

828
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:48,827
The meme that I sent you. We have laughed a lot.

829
00:51:48,888 --> 00:51:52,292
with him. It's a meme. You must have seen it. It's a

830
00:51:52,332 --> 00:51:55,753
meme of a clown who is there with

831
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:59,114
the mobile trying to help. Memes are just so hard to explain. This is a

832
00:51:59,154 --> 00:52:02,874
something very worthy of reflection. The other day our friend Paula

833
00:52:02,894 --> 00:52:06,495
He told me that he is going to publish something about memes and they are super difficult.

834
00:52:06,535 --> 00:52:09,936
of textualizing. It's that you don't textualize a meme.

835
00:52:09,976 --> 00:52:13,817
Well, I'm going to do it. But a clown is with a phone in

836
00:52:13,857 --> 00:52:18,502
the hand. And it says something like me advising

837
00:52:18,522 --> 00:52:21,966
in emotional stability to my friends owing

838
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:25,731
to be directly admitted. Well, that's my feeling when I try to

839
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:28,915
drag towards well-being. But anyway, to what we're getting at,

840
00:52:29,035 --> 00:52:33,099
the saint. Saint Teresa was also a scold, like me, when it came to tears.

841
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,843
Yes, in other words, she was mostly scolding with sadness because

842
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:40,167
She wants happy nuns. She wants happy nuns in her convents.

843
00:52:40,187 --> 00:52:42,930
so that she doesn't have any problems and because she knows, and it's true, that tyranny

844
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:46,974
the result of well-being actually has a lot to do with virtue. In other words, feeling good often is

845
00:52:47,034 --> 00:52:50,177
a decision, others do not. But in fact, she, when she has

846
00:52:50,217 --> 00:52:54,181
all those confrontations with the Inquisition in Seville due to discomforts and behaviors

847
00:52:54,241 --> 00:52:57,383
eccentricities of a couple of nuns, the first thing he asks of Maria de San

848
00:52:57,423 --> 00:53:00,526
José, the prioress of Seville, is to watch over the crying and the

849
00:53:00,566 --> 00:53:03,919
writing. It's what worries him the most. March 1, 1577.

850
00:53:03,929 --> 00:53:07,852
Write... Check. Check. Write Santa Teresa.

851
00:53:07,932 --> 00:53:11,735
from Toledo to Seville and he says to Maria de San Jose I would like to know...

852
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:15,336
She always controlling everything... I would like to know what this is.

853
00:53:15,396 --> 00:53:18,436
it says that it exerts so much force on God that it does not declare itself.

854
00:53:19,056 --> 00:53:22,257
Look at the work to walk now with those cries in front of the others and what

855
00:53:22,297 --> 00:53:25,678
see her write at every step. Seek that which she wrote.

856
00:53:25,698 --> 00:53:28,978
and send it to me and remove it from hope that she has to deal with

857
00:53:29,038 --> 00:53:32,559
"nobody but with our father who has destroyed it". In other words, it's like

858
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:36,399
don't let him cry, don't let him write, send me what he has written and let him

859
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:39,520
Forget about seeing anyone who is not our father, who was genuinely the aunt.

860
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,387
absolute controller. But of course, that brought her some problems.

861
00:53:43,427 --> 00:53:46,293
from these little crazy ones from Seville. How distrustful,

862
00:53:47,295 --> 00:53:49,038
Yes, but well, his life depended on it and he was committed to it.

863
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:52,460
project on that. I understand her very well. But well, not only she was suspicious,

864
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,222
In other words, there is another great pioneer of crying, who was the mystic Angela.

865
00:53:56,262 --> 00:53:59,364
from Foligno, who warned of the possible deception of tears, or in other words,

866
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:02,746
this was something that everyone had in mind. She says,

867
00:54:03,186 --> 00:54:06,168
and in the moment when the world flatters and looks at her, to this

868
00:54:06,228 --> 00:54:08,309
person, to this crying nun, whoever she may be,

869
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:12,772
the tears and the sweetness and the trembling and the grinding grow more.

870
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:16,194
that arises from this impure spiritual love. And although in love

871
00:54:16,234 --> 00:54:19,658
Impure spirit may have tears and sweetness, however they do not arise.

872
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:23,282
within the soul, but they do it in the body, and neither the

873
00:54:23,342 --> 00:54:27,146
"love penetrates within the soul". The key here is in

874
00:54:27,186 --> 00:54:30,410
the moment when the world flatters and looks at her. The moment.

875
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:34,054
in which you have an audience, that if you are there in front of them

876
00:54:34,234 --> 00:54:37,757
lights, this comes from the soul, comes from the body. This takes me

877
00:54:37,777 --> 00:54:40,959
to a question, Ana. I resume the role of asking.

878
00:54:41,739 --> 00:54:44,080
Do you believe in Dulceida's tears,

879
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:48,282
in this documentary that you and I have devoured in two nights,

880
00:54:48,302 --> 00:54:52,244
Do you believe that they are sweetness that arises from within the soul or impurities?

881
00:54:52,284 --> 00:54:55,245
that grow from the body while the world flatters and watches her?

882
00:54:55,847 --> 00:55:01,013
Where would we place her tears within the categorization that Catalina made?

883
00:55:01,033 --> 00:55:04,977
from Siena? We have a spectacular merit because, will we be the first ones?

884
00:55:05,057 --> 00:55:08,601
people trying to unravel the nature of Dulceida's tears

885
00:55:08,621 --> 00:55:12,165
through Catherine of Siena? Without a doubt. Without a doubt.

886
00:55:12,645 --> 00:55:15,967
I may not know other things, but this I know for sure. I will say, because we are gaining more and more listeners,

887
00:55:16,007 --> 00:55:19,569
of which we are very happy, and not all are in Spain.

888
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:23,031
For those who don't know who Dulceida is... You leave me perplexed? For whom do I not know?

889
00:55:23,551 --> 00:55:27,734
For those who don't know who Dulceida is, she is a Spanish influencer.

890
00:55:27,754 --> 00:55:31,096
very, very, very famous who just made a documentary about her life.

891
00:55:31,136 --> 00:55:34,338
of four episodes. That's it. I believe, once now.

892
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:37,940
explained, and in the documentary she cries, because as she is human,

893
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,762
then cry. I believe that your tears are impurities that

894
00:55:41,822 --> 00:55:44,523
They grow from the body while the world flatters and watches her. You?

895
00:55:46,244 --> 00:55:49,826
It's just that I don't know. I mean, there's something telling me that

896
00:55:49,926 --> 00:55:53,448
She has like too much

897
00:55:54,028 --> 00:55:58,030
simplicity, or in other words, purity of soul, let's say, as to generate impurities.

898
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:00,892
I believe these are genuine sweetness that arise in the poor creature.

899
00:56:01,863 --> 00:56:05,644
Well, here's a debate, you can, if any listener has also seen,

900
00:56:05,744 --> 00:56:08,845
I know there are listeners who have seen Dulceida's documentary, so they can.

901
00:56:08,905 --> 00:56:12,506
collaborate with us to try to unravel from the taxonomy of

902
00:56:12,546 --> 00:56:15,847
the tears of Catherine of Siena, the tears of Dulceida. But Carmen.

903
00:56:16,027 --> 00:56:18,528
Well, Angela de Folín will be there. Sorry, it's true, Angela de Folín. No, no, no,

904
00:56:18,548 --> 00:56:22,169
because I was also thinking. They lift me up, I feel it.

905
00:56:22,749 --> 00:56:26,808
The t-shirt is torn. The podcast is over. You can't.

906
00:56:26,868 --> 00:56:30,910
confuse the medieval musics. But Carmen, let's not forget yet about

907
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:34,532
the tears of Saint Teresa, why? Who is our Saint Teresa?

908
00:56:34,612 --> 00:56:38,334
Favorite? Teresa, the friend, the friend. Without batting an eye. And of course,

909
00:56:38,755 --> 00:56:42,117
in the end, like all others, Santa Teresa, our theory,

910
00:56:42,157 --> 00:56:45,459
and what we never tire of repeating, is that I believe she was a friend before

911
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:48,941
what a prioress. And notice that Carmen would say friend before Carmelita.

912
00:56:48,961 --> 00:56:52,623
And notice that her entire identity was being a barefoot Carmelite, because she made it up herself.

913
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:56,366
and she does it. But she was a friend, a friend of her friends. The identity

914
00:56:56,406 --> 00:56:59,949
Teresa's was based on friendly charisma like ours,

915
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:03,633
I would say. A huge hug to all the friends that we miss a lot.

916
00:57:03,693 --> 00:57:06,816
less. In foundations, this is true.

917
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:10,660
It makes me sad, in the foundations they tell you about all the suffering.

918
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,444
and the crying that accompanied the farewells. And I can't help but

919
00:57:14,484 --> 00:57:17,948
to feel an enormous empathy. He says, And in letting go

920
00:57:17,968 --> 00:57:20,730
to my daughters and sisters when I was going from one place to another,

921
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:24,073
I tell you that as much as I love them, it has not been the most.

922
00:57:24,133 --> 00:57:27,696
small cross, especially when I thought I would never see them again and

923
00:57:28,117 --> 00:57:31,620
I saw his great feelings and tears. Even though they are about other things.

924
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,083
unattached, this one has not been given by God, perhaps so that

925
00:57:35,123 --> 00:57:37,985
it would be more torment for me, that I am not even from them, or rather,

926
00:57:38,026 --> 00:57:41,648
I am also not detached from them. Even though I was trying as hard as I could to

927
00:57:41,688 --> 00:57:45,210
I did not show it to him and scolded him, but it did me little good. For it is great, the

928
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:48,653
"love they have for me and it shows, in many things, is true."

929
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:52,235
In other words, he dies of sadness when he says goodbye. This is too much.

930
00:57:52,355 --> 00:57:56,017
pain. And on top of that, it's like he scolds her because she has to be strong.

931
00:57:56,037 --> 00:57:59,839
and he cannot improve it. He has to pull the cart. Without stopping,

932
00:57:59,899 --> 00:58:03,482
pull the cart. It's kind of like the clown meme. The meme.

933
00:58:03,502 --> 00:58:06,923
of the clown. Poor Santa Teresa. And finally, it's that he/she has

934
00:58:06,943 --> 00:58:10,585
an expression that I believe we need to appropriate ourselves and all the listeners,

935
00:58:11,045 --> 00:58:13,846
What it is that when General Rubeo of the Carmelite order dies, look at it.

936
00:58:13,886 --> 00:58:17,868
that says. It says, I'm very tender and the first day I cry that

937
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:20,789
You will cry without being able to do anything else. Cry that you will cry.

938
00:58:20,809 --> 00:58:24,511
Cry, you will cry. I am extremely tender on the first day and cry, you will cry without being able to.

939
00:58:24,531 --> 00:58:26,732
do something else. And there's nothing more. Poor thing.

940
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:45,354
In our most favorite centuries, they were very worried, just like now.

941
00:58:45,394 --> 00:58:48,016
reality, crocodile tears. Yes,

942
00:58:48,656 --> 00:58:52,777
tears that you couldn't trust. But, in this context

943
00:58:52,838 --> 00:58:56,459
of suspicions towards crying, which were extremely widespread,

944
00:58:56,519 --> 00:58:59,920
which is also echoed by Santa Teresa, already at the beginning of the

945
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:03,762
In the 16th century, there was a woman who completely had her way. We love these,

946
00:59:03,862 --> 00:59:07,924
like... We love them. She articulates a very complex rhetoric.

947
00:59:07,984 --> 00:59:11,325
from crying and managed to prevent her tears from being questioned

948
00:59:11,385 --> 00:59:15,027
at no time, as if they were those of other religious women then, and as if they were

949
00:59:15,047 --> 00:59:18,188
They are now Dulceida's, Bela Hadid's,

950
00:59:18,248 --> 00:59:22,049
or well, whichever they probably are, I feel this

951
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:25,591
reference but I'm going to make it, the most suspected and suspicious tears of

952
00:59:25,611 --> 00:59:28,572
Spain, those of Lidia Lozano on the Sálvame plate. That's it.

953
00:59:28,872 --> 00:59:32,534
Enchant me and save me. Do you remember when we saw

954
00:59:32,554 --> 00:59:36,275
that summer we spent in Seville? It's true, when we went to the archive.

955
00:59:36,295 --> 00:59:39,916
from the Indies. And one afternoon we started watching Save Me.

956
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:43,358
And we said, this is close reading what we do. It's close reading.

957
00:59:43,478 --> 00:59:46,559
It is literally close reading Save Me.

958
00:59:46,659 --> 00:59:50,280
But Lidia Lozano is from her tears.

959
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,121
But this woman who got her way with such immense rhetorical talent

960
00:59:54,221 --> 00:59:57,422
it was Maria of Santo Domingo, also known as

961
00:59:57,502 --> 01:00:00,947
the Blessed of Piedra Ita in Avila. We find her quite charming.

962
01:00:00,967 --> 01:00:04,028
and we no longer know her very closely, although we are taking it slowly.

963
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:08,830
Getting intimate with her because we have already talked about her once.

964
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:12,812
a bit of a rundown with all their food delusions in our dedicated episode

965
01:00:12,832 --> 01:00:16,393
to fasts and greedy nuns. Yes, we have talked about something.

966
01:00:16,433 --> 01:00:19,835
from her. She had a bit of everything, so it gives material for many episodes,

967
01:00:19,915 --> 01:00:24,316
because she didn't have a few things. She was quite charismatic. Yes, she was charismatic.

968
01:00:24,336 --> 01:00:28,278
Let's go. So she... Let's see, actually she didn't get off completely scot-free.

969
01:00:28,298 --> 01:00:33,260
And indeed, he had to endure quite serious accusations being thrown at him.

970
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,501
And between 1508 and 1510, up to four proceedings were opened against him.

971
01:00:36,601 --> 01:00:40,363
questioning his orthodoxy. In other words, it wasn't all that either.

972
01:00:40,443 --> 01:00:43,324
Easy for her. But it had nothing to do with tears.

973
01:00:43,805 --> 01:00:47,327
Although now we will see that she was very much into driving and spreading.

974
01:00:47,387 --> 01:00:50,729
a good cry, above all, he was very good at spreading it,

975
01:00:52,911 --> 01:00:56,573
In reality, they were pursuing her for other reasons that called into question her orthodoxy.

976
01:00:57,214 --> 01:01:00,236
Much had to do with his appearance, attention,

977
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:04,098
because apparently she was gorgeous. Moon of

978
01:01:04,138 --> 01:01:08,241
Almeida is a gentleman who in 1930 published a book about her and him.

979
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:11,503
It compiles the testimonies of the time and tells you this.

980
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:15,184
the historian of the 1930s says it. He tells you, based on what he gathers,

981
01:01:15,424 --> 01:01:17,744
who was said to be a splendid woman,

982
01:01:18,064 --> 01:01:20,705
arrogant, friendly, of incomparable beauty,

983
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:24,786
for its attractiveness and suggestiveness, whose conditions, combined with a clearness

984
01:01:24,846 --> 01:01:28,767
extraordinary natural, soon made her be tenaciously admired by men and

985
01:01:29,027 --> 01:01:32,127
not at all envied by women in all aspects. I love this way of

986
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:36,290
Making history of the 30s, which is like... Hilarious. I would love to.

987
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:38,853
Power, it's just that it's a bit of fanfiction which is what we want to do, you and

988
01:01:38,893 --> 01:01:41,456
me. Actually, it's the only thing we want. It's like, I ran that day the wind.

989
01:01:41,496 --> 01:01:45,722
In the Escorial, stronger than usual. Philip II distressed.

990
01:01:46,683 --> 01:01:50,247
It was a day. But well, a question Carmen, do you consider yourself

991
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:55,134
Like Maria from Santo Domingo, arrogant and friendly? No, honestly.

992
01:01:55,154 --> 01:01:58,719
I don't consider myself arrogant at all. In fact,

993
01:01:58,779 --> 01:02:02,024
I would say that I am involuntarily self-parodic, which is something that

994
01:02:02,044 --> 01:02:05,890
Sometimes I don't like it. But I am definitely nice. I believe I am really great.

995
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:10,174
And you? Me, friendly, that is, being friendly is work.

996
01:02:10,194 --> 01:02:13,758
full time. I'm super nice. It's true that I'm super nice when

997
01:02:13,778 --> 01:02:16,760
I've been told that I'm really great when, I mean, like if someone is

998
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,104
It pierces me, the level of indifference is quite high, and that.

999
01:02:20,544 --> 01:02:23,086
It can be perceived as arrogance, but I don't think it is at all.

1000
01:02:24,047 --> 01:02:26,950
Interesting. It's just that I'm thinking... Of course,

1001
01:02:27,591 --> 01:02:30,594
when you and I... It's a very long story.

1002
01:02:30,634 --> 01:02:34,037
We reserve it for another day. Yes, because we have to go back to... It's happening to me.

1003
01:02:34,778 --> 01:02:38,402
having the downturn of... Let's continue talking about the Blessed One from Piedraíta.

1004
01:02:38,702 --> 01:02:42,065
We return to María de Santo Domingo, Blessed of Piedraíta. Something that

1005
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:45,529
The translation doesn't make much sense as the sentence seems to be incomplete or incorrectly structured. A possible interpretation could be "She greatly deceived the people around her." However, it would be helpful to have more context or a more grammatically correct sentence.

1006
01:02:45,569 --> 01:02:48,810
beauty that she had these visions of hers,

1007
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:52,131
because she had visions, with her very long and reddish-blond hair

1008
01:02:52,191 --> 01:02:55,432
because he was accused of artificially lightening his

1009
01:02:55,452 --> 01:02:58,663
hairs. Please, between 1508

1010
01:02:58,673 --> 01:03:02,274
And in 1510, this gorgeous woman was bleaching her hair with bleach.

1011
01:03:02,294 --> 01:03:05,814
and having visions. Everything is in our most favorite centuries.

1012
01:03:05,874 --> 01:03:09,175
But it's not just that she would bleach her hair and let it grow long.

1013
01:03:09,235 --> 01:03:13,016
not to look prettier than she was, but she dressed in robes.

1014
01:03:13,076 --> 01:03:16,577
Extremely elegant in garnet color always and wore coral jewelry.

1015
01:03:17,217 --> 01:03:20,418
Of course, it should be clarified here that she was a tertiary Dominican and that she did not.

1016
01:03:20,438 --> 01:03:23,599
It is a tertiary custom to dress in habit, so he dressed in whatever he was given.

1017
01:03:23,619 --> 01:03:27,040
the desire. It's just that there are phrases that come out naturally in the episode,

1018
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:30,541
but I think about the oddity of it not being a tertiary custom to dress with

1019
01:03:30,581 --> 01:03:34,202
habit. As you know. As we all know. Well,

1020
01:03:34,302 --> 01:03:37,303
this must be said, because if not, it is not understood. So,

1021
01:03:38,464 --> 01:03:41,384
She dressed however she pleased and did not make austere decisions.

1022
01:03:41,825 --> 01:03:45,866
Very good, I love it. But I was able to combine those little luxuries.

1023
01:03:45,967 --> 01:03:49,468
as a good vain woman with her conceit, with her most devout prayer,

1024
01:03:49,488 --> 01:03:53,210
his rigorous discipline and above all with his great abundance

1025
01:03:53,271 --> 01:03:56,372
of tears, which was a sign of holiness that Maria de Santo Domingo managed to handle.

1026
01:03:56,412 --> 01:03:59,414
that, as we have said very well, far from any ambiguity, from any suspicion.

1027
01:03:59,894 --> 01:04:03,135
Let's see, she has this book, the book of the prayer of Maria Santo Domingo,

1028
01:04:03,155 --> 01:04:06,916
there are collected, well, among other things they include several

1029
01:04:06,956 --> 01:04:10,396
visions and a rapture just as she had them. That is,

1030
01:04:10,436 --> 01:04:14,277
I don't know whether to say how I portrayed her, in front of those who would see her.

1031
01:04:14,297 --> 01:04:17,958
So, something like scripted and staged visions,

1032
01:04:17,978 --> 01:04:21,679
She is a very theatrical visionary, somewhat in the style of Baltasara.

1033
01:04:21,699 --> 01:04:24,979
About Baltasara, completely. The hermit actress we talked about in the episode.

1034
01:04:24,999 --> 01:04:28,200
from Granada two weeks ago. Well, but to what we are going today.

1035
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:32,542
The main protagonist of their ordeal is the gift of tears. Therefore,

1036
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:36,404
First of all, she begins by invoking them. It is an invocation of tears,

1037
01:04:36,444 --> 01:04:38,986
a good invocation of tears. If one day they don't come out,

1038
01:04:39,586 --> 01:04:42,188
You are there, kind of wanting to cry but you can't.

1039
01:04:42,528 --> 01:04:45,970
You can repeat the words in the manner of Santo Domingo. Come on, close your eyes.

1040
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:49,491
all. So give me, then, some of that love and warmth that you gave to your pious

1041
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:52,653
Magdalena. Give me from those streams and tears.

1042
01:04:52,713 --> 01:04:55,334
that they did not tire in her and may they dry up in me.

1043
01:04:56,235 --> 01:04:59,916
Give me, oh merciful queen, some little ones of your pains and loves with

1044
01:04:59,976 --> 01:05:03,238
let me cry. Give me that my eyes do not tire, oh woe of

1045
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:06,920
me, who they dried up and my sources ceased and I no longer know how to call him.

1046
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:11,342
Give me, most benign Father, that taste and tears that you gave.

1047
01:05:11,362 --> 01:05:14,823
to your precious Magdalena, because she thought heaven and earth were not enough.

1048
01:05:14,903 --> 01:05:18,254
to give it all for you. It's a beauty. I must say.

1049
01:05:18,274 --> 01:05:21,476
that this invocation, as you were reading and listening very

1050
01:05:21,536 --> 01:05:25,638
attentive, it seemed very adaptable for a song. Not for us,

1051
01:05:25,778 --> 01:05:29,020
but for Rosalía. She might hear us from Monja or Motomami,

1052
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:32,983
maybe he will listen to us and be encouraged to do his version. Do you remember when we gave him a

1053
01:05:33,223 --> 01:05:36,945
good idea for a verse? This is about these are the tears.

1054
01:05:36,985 --> 01:05:40,207
of your baby. Your baby's tears. It's just that all these things about tears...

1055
01:05:40,727 --> 01:05:44,072
Of course, Maria Santo Domingo was very shrewd in choosing Maria Magdalena because,

1056
01:05:44,132 --> 01:05:47,196
like in the book of tears, that one I found, and sorry again

1057
01:05:47,236 --> 01:05:50,821
in English, but they say that Mary Magdalene was the biblical weeper,

1058
01:05:50,841 --> 01:05:54,346
In other words, like the quintessential biblical weeper, and it provided a lot of material.

1059
01:05:54,406 --> 01:05:58,089
because, on one hand, they were like very utilitarian tears, those of

1060
01:05:58,149 --> 01:06:01,851
Mary Magdalene, and they became like

1061
01:06:01,871 --> 01:06:05,153
in a super common trope of preaching, especially in the Middle Ages and

1062
01:06:05,373 --> 01:06:09,655
in the 16th and 17th centuries, because their tears on one hand indicated female weakness

1063
01:06:09,695 --> 01:06:13,377
and repentance, but on the other hand, they marked an approach to the ministry.

1064
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:16,599
of God. They served you as rhetoric of humility,

1065
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:20,602
but they also served you as a way to claim divine authority. And it's that Magdalena

1066
01:06:20,682 --> 01:06:24,224
Carmen cries three times in the Bible. I am not special to know.

1067
01:06:24,264 --> 01:06:28,207
to the Bible at all. But Mary Magdalene cries three times and has

1068
01:06:28,227 --> 01:06:32,690
the privilege of being the first to see Jesus newly resurrected.

1069
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:37,992
Can I read you the little piece from the Gospel of John in the

1070
01:06:38,072 --> 01:06:41,413
Is it told how Mary Magdalene cries the first time she sees Jesus?

1071
01:06:41,533 --> 01:06:44,394
Well, please, I beg you. It's just that it makes me laugh a lot because

1072
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:47,636
I was thinking about this the other day while reading this, which seems to me like a story.

1073
01:06:47,676 --> 01:06:51,137
super overwhelmed with ignorance and recognitions, which is a bit like the Bible

1074
01:06:51,157 --> 01:06:54,799
It's all the time like that, like very confused people, people changing, but not.

1075
01:06:54,859 --> 01:06:57,640
it was you, yes, it's me. I mean, it's quite funny to me.

1076
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:02,284
This is a moment like the great highlight of the Bible.

1077
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:20,543
"Woman, why are you crying?" He said to them.

1078
01:07:20,563 --> 01:07:23,385
-"Because they have taken my lord and I do not know where they have put him."

1079
01:07:23,945 --> 01:07:26,868
As soon as she said this, Maria turned around and saw Jesus who was there,

1080
01:07:26,968 --> 01:07:30,031
but she did not realize that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her,

1081
01:07:30,051 --> 01:07:33,694
-"Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?". She, thinking that Jesus was the

1082
01:07:33,714 --> 01:07:37,117
gardener, he said, - "Sir, if you have taken it, tell me where you have put it.

1083
01:07:37,157 --> 01:07:40,299
said to him, "I will take it with me". And Jesus said to her, -"Mary!". Then she turned and said to him

1084
01:07:40,359 --> 01:07:43,302
He said in Hebrew, -"Raboni!". Which means teacher. In other words, it makes me...

1085
01:07:44,181 --> 01:07:47,782
A charm, the scene, I don't know if it's just me, like that

1086
01:07:47,822 --> 01:07:52,604
We are in this delirium. And all this that you say about anagnosis.

1087
01:07:52,684 --> 01:07:55,926
The Bible as a book in which no one understands anything about what is happening.

1088
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:59,387
passing by. Everyone, like many people all the time. By the way,

1089
01:07:59,447 --> 01:08:02,728
many thanks to Blackybooks who gifted us the Genesis. And me

1090
01:08:02,768 --> 01:08:05,489
I was also remembering that when we asked him,

1091
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:10,031
when we were talking with David Macho at La Casa Encendida, because why

1092
01:08:10,051 --> 01:08:13,012
he had started making Moe's TikToks, it's because obviously, because he was inspired by

1093
01:08:13,052 --> 01:08:16,594
the Bible for his paintings which are like biblical, like many others

1094
01:08:16,694 --> 01:08:18,895
Little people doing things simultaneously.

1095
01:08:20,716 --> 01:08:24,278
Greetings, David. Greetings. Wait, it's just that I've stayed in

1096
01:08:24,298 --> 01:08:28,040
the extremely clogged Bible. It's just that the Bible gives so much.

1097
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:31,482
Yes, the Bible offers a great deal, one must be careful. I love the Bible because

1098
01:08:31,603 --> 01:08:35,085
if you don't know it. It gives a lot.

1099
01:08:35,145 --> 01:08:38,527
Bible. Wait, we're about to talk about the Bible. Well, another day.

1100
01:08:39,107 --> 01:08:43,870
we talk about more things from the Bible. Although well, this thing you say about

1101
01:08:44,029 --> 01:08:46,892
that there are about three cries of Mary Magdalene, I think I read that of the Virgin

1102
01:08:47,152 --> 01:08:50,376
Actually, for everything that exists, we will later talk for a moment about iconography.

1103
01:08:50,435 --> 01:08:54,160
but for how iconic the weeping of the Virgin is, in reality the Virgin

1104
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:58,265
Mary in the Bible only cries twice. And as

1105
01:08:58,305 --> 01:09:01,929
it contrasts between the brief appearances in the Bible and then everything

1106
01:09:01,988 --> 01:09:05,173
what has been represented afterwards, gives a lot. But that

1107
01:09:05,212 --> 01:09:08,316
we'll talk later. But okay, Maria from Santo Domingo, we've agreed that

1108
01:09:08,336 --> 01:09:12,300
She was extremely smart, invoking tears, knowing perfectly well how to get involved.

1109
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:16,743
in this biblical story to take possession of the tears of

1110
01:09:16,804 --> 01:09:20,207
everyone, basically, and represent them. And then, from here, from the beginning.

1111
01:09:20,227 --> 01:09:23,290
from this invocation, everything is a delirium of tears in which Maria de Santo

1112
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:26,513
Sunday turns towards her, becoming the ventriloquist of the Virgin's weeping,

1113
01:09:26,953 --> 01:09:30,676
from the weeping of Mary Magdalene, from the weeping of the apostles too.

1114
01:09:31,216 --> 01:09:33,599
But it's just that even from the very tears of Christ himself.

1115
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,443
She, but these roles she represents, she doesn't write them alone. She is there and

1116
01:09:38,523 --> 01:09:42,667
he says, like Christ, crying with my mother expressing sorrow

1117
01:09:42,767 --> 01:09:46,389
very large with all the creatures that were around me at that time.

1118
01:09:46,408 --> 01:09:46,930
they did.

1119
01:09:50,173 --> 01:09:53,796
I find it incredible that all of this was left out of the process, because even if it was in

1120
01:09:53,816 --> 01:09:57,460
the context of the visionary performance, that representation in their own

1121
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,023
meats from the tears of Christ, as if it was approaching very dangerously

1122
01:10:01,043 --> 01:10:04,987
to adopt a certain role almost like a co-redeemer. She was playing with

1123
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:07,910
Fire Maria Santo Dominguez. All these women were tremendous.

1124
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:11,533
Something we always say that fascinates us about all these mystical nuns and

1125
01:10:11,593 --> 01:10:16,018
The general perception of premodern women is that they were like little tightrope walkers.

1126
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:19,021
that they could fall on the side of salvation as well as on the side of the

1127
01:10:19,501 --> 01:10:23,185
more atrocious sentence. Because any

1128
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:26,428
Stumbling in our most favorite centuries of life could ruin you.

1129
01:10:28,109 --> 01:10:32,992
Why was Maria Santo Domingo saved? They were the juggling emoji.

1130
01:10:35,954 --> 01:10:39,316
Rebeca de San Martín explains this. She says that if her rhetoric of the

1131
01:10:39,356 --> 01:10:42,758
Leyremas was successful, it was partly due to

1132
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,379
for their skill in handling all this rhetoric,

1133
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:48,800
also making participants of the weeping

1134
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,301
to the viewers, as if she was very talented in that, as if it was a thing.

1135
01:10:52,821 --> 01:10:55,521
collective. But here, we all cry.

1136
01:10:57,282 --> 01:11:01,123
The spectators, of course, start shedding tears when they see

1137
01:11:01,203 --> 01:11:04,504
and they hear Maria, and they are especially moved.

1138
01:11:04,664 --> 01:11:08,805
with the vision of passion. It's a show.

1139
01:11:08,965 --> 01:11:12,789
quite crazy, and she goes on giving voice

1140
01:11:12,809 --> 01:11:16,232
to the various characters who are appearing and reminiscing about themselves at the same time.

1141
01:11:16,292 --> 01:11:19,695
Crying. It's like a folklore of the grasses. She is a playwright. Is she a playwright?

1142
01:11:19,855 --> 01:11:23,679
She is a playwright. Directly a playwright. Totally. She says... Oh good.

1143
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:26,662
Jesus, how sweet music is to the sinner, your merciful wounds,

1144
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:30,986
that if one thinks so much about them, that they manage to enjoy and feel something

1145
01:11:31,066 --> 01:11:34,228
little thing of his softness and sweetness, with what love does he wake up

1146
01:11:34,309 --> 01:11:38,191
Cry for them and not remove them from your thoughts? Few things

1147
01:11:38,251 --> 01:11:41,595
I like more in life than the word little thing.

1148
01:11:42,156 --> 01:11:45,661
in any text prior to the 18th century. Little thing of softness and sweetness, what do I

1149
01:11:45,721 --> 01:11:49,225
you say? What are you telling me? What do you tell me about little thing,

1150
01:11:49,386 --> 01:11:52,770
of softness and sweetness? Laugh at Bad Bunny. With this

1151
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:55,693
you haven't cried in two days. Well,

1152
01:11:56,094 --> 01:11:59,117
this is one of the reasons, but I think one of the reasons

1153
01:11:59,237 --> 01:12:03,042
also because everything worked for Maria Santo Domingos is because she already

1154
01:12:03,082 --> 01:12:06,225
this gentleman said it at the beginning, in 1930, because he was

1155
01:12:06,265 --> 01:12:10,070
very beautiful and because she surely found a gesture of crying that

1156
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:13,934
emotional enough not to become disadvantageous,

1157
01:12:14,014 --> 01:12:17,477
You know? As if that matters, the degree thing. Of course, there's nothing like it.

1158
01:12:17,517 --> 01:12:21,380
To charm with gestures, as if you were gathering all of them.

1159
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:25,303
your blessings, whatever they may be, are seductive, and casting you out

1160
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:29,587
the world for a hat, which is infallible in any century. Always that.

1161
01:12:30,007 --> 01:12:33,330
Look, you said before, and here we bring it up again, that crying is quite beautifying.

1162
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:37,533
And it came to my mind, well, this is something that I

1163
01:12:37,573 --> 01:12:40,935
my grandmother used to say, repeating it every time I cried when I was little,

1164
01:12:40,995 --> 01:12:43,818
he told me, don't cry because it makes you look very ugly. That phrase is a classic.

1165
01:12:43,838 --> 01:12:47,560
But of course, imagine, right? I mean, you're a girl and you're stuck in your own misery.

1166
01:12:47,721 --> 01:12:51,003
at a moment when the concern that you already have, well there it is

1167
01:12:51,023 --> 01:12:54,466
it adds the worry of thinking, which leaves you completely

1168
01:12:54,506 --> 01:12:58,149
offside, plus how

1169
01:12:58,189 --> 01:13:00,891
Your appearance is going to be perceived. In other words, this seems quite tyrannical to me.

1170
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:06,414
But I was also left perplexed because

1171
01:13:06,574 --> 01:13:09,696
I already had integrated this aspiration that

1172
01:13:09,736 --> 01:13:13,539
Crying actually beautifies. So I understood it as, how am I going to be ugly if I cry.

1173
01:13:13,599 --> 01:13:17,241
It assumes that I should be pretty. Damn it, it didn't work for me. And it's been

1174
01:13:17,321 --> 01:13:21,184
a little, and here I take the opportunity to make a recommendation, I read a book.

1175
01:13:21,484 --> 01:13:22,685
I really liked it a lot.

1176
01:13:23,085 --> 01:13:26,687
It's from Heather Crystal and

1177
01:13:26,727 --> 01:13:29,989
In English it has been translated as the book of tears, which has been edited by

1178
01:13:30,069 --> 01:13:33,291
Traffic. Well, I apologize to... It's a

1179
01:13:33,311 --> 01:13:37,452
book as wonderful that connects you... They are like scraps of

1180
01:13:37,552 --> 01:13:41,794
ideas and a little thread that is weaving ideas and data about

1181
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:45,435
the crying, and it's super good. And I apologize to Magdalena.

1182
01:13:45,535 --> 01:13:49,237
Palmer, who is like the translator, and I apologize to

1183
01:13:49,277 --> 01:13:51,898
everyone because I... I only have the English version so I'm going to

1184
01:13:51,938 --> 01:13:55,580
Translate. Condemning tears. Then another one of contrition. My tears.

1185
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:58,962
out of contrition because I am going to translate the paragraph very clumsily.

1186
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:02,064
The book opens precisely discussing this, about crying and appearance.

1187
01:14:02,824 --> 01:14:06,827
He says, I guess some people can cry softly and beautify themselves,

1188
01:14:07,387 --> 01:14:10,669
but after a real cry, most of them look horrible, as if they

1189
01:14:10,969 --> 01:14:14,511
a sick face would have grown under the one you know, leaving very little

1190
01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:17,893
space for the eyes. Or they seem beaten. We seem.

1191
01:14:18,314 --> 01:14:21,656
I seem to. Once in fifth grade, I cried at school for some reason.

1192
01:14:21,716 --> 01:14:25,419
that I don't remember and then a popular guy, ponytail, skateboard, told me

1193
01:14:25,459 --> 01:14:29,282
that she seemed like a drug addict and it pleased me quite a bit to be seen and I made her repeat it.

1194
01:14:29,542 --> 01:14:32,604
Be careful with being seen and crying, it's that we are going back to

1195
01:14:32,624 --> 01:14:35,446
María of Santo Domingo. This is what Angela of Foligno used to say about her.

1196
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:39,169
Afterwards, once you know you are being watched, things change.

1197
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:43,813
Things change. I really want to read this book. I can't resist.

1198
01:14:44,653 --> 01:14:47,455
just in case the crying overwhelms you, friends, just in case the crying overwhelms you,

1199
01:14:47,535 --> 01:14:50,957
Carmen, one day in such an unstoppable way that, as Heather Christie says,

1200
01:14:50,977 --> 01:14:54,119
the eyes shrink until they almost disappear, to bring you a small

1201
01:14:54,219 --> 01:14:57,501
remedy to stop the tears that I have found, calmly,

1202
01:14:57,521 --> 01:15:00,783
in the Brief Treaty of Medicine and all the diseases that affect

1203
01:15:00,843 --> 01:15:05,276
each step is offered by a certain Fray Agustín Farfán from 1592.

1204
01:15:05,286 --> 01:15:06,327
Another friend more!

1205
01:15:24,519 --> 01:15:28,024
All of this in powder heals sores and its water cures corrosion.

1206
01:15:28,044 --> 01:15:31,409
and soothes the eyes and stops the tears. Super sloppy.

1207
01:15:31,749 --> 01:15:35,234
in the instructions. Friar Agustin and a completely indecipherable remedy,

1208
01:15:35,274 --> 01:15:38,678
but there it is. In other words, we bring you what we find here. Don't do this.

1209
01:15:38,758 --> 01:15:39,259
filth.

1210
01:15:40,637 --> 01:15:47,162
To the Pig,

1211
01:15:47,202 --> 01:15:50,785
I'm going to say it, to Agustin Barfán, the pig. He loved it.

1212
01:15:50,825 --> 01:15:54,068
the instructions, as generally to any gentleman who prides himself.

1213
01:15:54,728 --> 01:15:58,711
I insist, Ana, that it's not. It's just that this part isn't.

1214
01:15:58,731 --> 01:16:01,634
I had seen the script and I have looked at the reel and I have seen a name and

1215
01:16:01,674 --> 01:16:05,277
I say This cannot be happening. But everything has

1216
01:16:05,338 --> 01:16:09,242
your why. I know that in you I would grant

1217
01:16:09,302 --> 01:16:13,026
my soul for you to do with it as you wish. Because if this were

1218
01:16:13,106 --> 01:16:15,048
a very heavy podcast, which it is not,

1219
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:20,394
Well, we would start talking here about Julio's instructions for crying.

1220
01:16:20,434 --> 01:16:23,837
Cortázar. Trumpets of the apocalypse. But Maria Santo,

1221
01:16:23,897 --> 01:16:27,120
Sunday, Saint Teresa and all our saints deliver them, because no, it's not that.

1222
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:30,862
But everything has come to me because of this book from the book of the

1223
01:16:30,922 --> 01:16:34,605
Heather Christel's tears mentions it, also very briefly, and me

1224
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:37,708
he has come because this is something that I did not have on my radar, fortunately,

1225
01:16:38,088 --> 01:16:41,611
Because what's the need. Who wants to have Cortázar on their radar? Well, but no.

1226
01:16:41,651 --> 01:16:44,813
I resist quoting a phrase that includes him saying this,

1227
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:49,117
because I don't understand it. It says, to cry direct your imagination towards yourself.

1228
01:16:49,297 --> 01:16:52,719
And if this is impossible for him because he has acquired the habit of believing in

1229
01:16:52,759 --> 01:16:55,882
the outside world, think of a duck covered in ants

1230
01:16:55,902 --> 01:16:59,405
or in those gulfs of the Strait of Magellan where no one ever goes.

1231
01:16:59,705 --> 01:17:03,128
Who has this ever made cry? I mean, no one ever. No one ever.

1232
01:17:03,228 --> 01:17:06,310
Juliet and Czar. What are you saying? You cry for love.

1233
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:10,263
Are you crying? You're crying. Are you crying for passion?

1234
01:17:10,323 --> 01:17:14,166
from a Good Friday? Do you cry for bilocation? Do you cry for saying goodbye?

1235
01:17:14,207 --> 01:17:16,849
from your friends? Don't you cry for a Magellan strait?

1236
01:17:16,869 --> 01:17:20,552
Do you cry because they dismantle the foundation of the convent?

1237
01:17:21,212 --> 01:17:24,535
Are you crying over a duck and its ants? What are you saying,

1238
01:17:25,176 --> 01:17:28,178
Cortázar? There's so much to cry about, really?

1239
01:17:28,839 --> 01:17:32,142
What need? What are you saying about a Strait of Magellan?

1240
01:17:32,662 --> 01:17:36,767
Shut up! No, never mind. Sure, about the instructions.

1241
01:17:37,007 --> 01:17:39,911
it's because I've found some instructions that I like much more.

1242
01:17:40,192 --> 01:17:43,656
Whose instructions are those? Instructions for crying.

1243
01:17:43,676 --> 01:17:47,481
from 1683. Of course! From Father José Vidal, who was

1244
01:17:47,521 --> 01:17:50,004
a wonderful Jesuit. He was a Jesuit!

1245
01:17:51,786 --> 01:17:56,969
He was a Jesuit from New Spain who wrote

1246
01:17:57,350 --> 01:18:00,832
Tender memories, alarm clock, affectionate and practical devotions.

1247
01:18:00,912 --> 01:18:03,914
with the sorrows of the Blessed Virgin taken from various authors.

1248
01:18:05,504 --> 01:18:08,829
A remix of the Virgin's cry. Why?

1249
01:18:08,869 --> 01:18:13,314
I love these instructions? I have

1250
01:18:13,334 --> 01:18:16,799
advanced before. It's just that sometimes I lose control and I haven't been able to avoid it with

1251
01:18:16,839 --> 01:18:20,523
this about the mentions in the Bible of weeping. To the biblical weepers.

1252
01:18:22,866 --> 01:18:25,970
The biblical weepers, and it is very striking, that the Virgin

1253
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:29,273
Maria actually seems to cry a little and yet she is represented as

1254
01:18:29,353 --> 01:18:32,937
many. It's very striking, it's very pictorial.

1255
01:18:33,017 --> 01:18:36,401
But it also sometimes ventures into slightly swampy terrain.

1256
01:18:36,661 --> 01:18:40,325
And Father José Vidal actually gets involved in quite a few messes.

1257
01:18:41,206 --> 01:18:44,449
Classic Jesuit, getting involved in all the messes you can. Yes,

1258
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:47,651
because it ends up turning her, the Virgin,

1259
01:18:47,771 --> 01:18:51,915
in co-redeemer. That is, as if it gives her an exacerbated protagonism.

1260
01:18:51,975 --> 01:19:03,457
to crying. He says, He put the extremely painful

1261
01:19:03,557 --> 01:19:06,999
mother... The extremely sorrowful mother set her eyes

1262
01:19:07,059 --> 01:19:10,342
in the divine face of her beloved, and she met with his eyes and gaze.

1263
01:19:10,362 --> 01:19:14,024
of Jesus, who as ambassadors gave reciprocal and mutual

1264
01:19:14,225 --> 01:19:17,647
News of the anguish and afflictions suffered by souls

1265
01:19:17,707 --> 01:19:21,710
of the two tender sovereign lovers. In other words, it's a thing of crazy glances here.

1266
01:19:23,251 --> 01:19:26,796
As if the Virgin looks into the eyes of her son and through them

1267
01:19:26,856 --> 01:19:30,501
The eyes of her son are as if they sucked all the pain from her.

1268
01:19:30,561 --> 01:19:34,747
of God, Christ suffers and so does she.

1269
01:19:34,847 --> 01:19:38,512
it takes over him. It is quite strong. In fact, he goes on to say the following,

1270
01:19:38,552 --> 01:19:41,295
that you can say it while I eat another one. That, in a certain way,

1271
01:19:41,575 --> 01:19:45,077
The Blessed Virgin suffered more than her son. Or rather,

1272
01:19:45,137 --> 01:19:48,640
because Christ suffered the most intense pains in the body and Mary in the

1273
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:52,642
soul, that the most delicate body, the pains were more sensitive to

1274
01:19:52,702 --> 01:19:56,145
Maria suffered more than Christ, and for that reason they say that the Virgin suffered more.

1275
01:19:56,185 --> 01:19:59,793
that your son. I read myself. Did you read a book called,

1276
01:19:59,913 --> 01:20:03,494
from this Irish author, Colm Toivín, the one who

1277
01:20:03,514 --> 01:20:06,155
wrote this very famous book called Brooklyn? He has a book that is

1278
01:20:06,195 --> 01:20:10,397
It's called The Testament of Mary. It's a very short monologue.

1279
01:20:10,417 --> 01:20:13,778
which is like a monologue that narrates the death of Christ from the

1280
01:20:13,818 --> 01:20:18,220
Maria's suffering. I want to read it. They made a theater adaptation.

1281
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:22,242
Which theater was it? And it was Blanca Portillo and it was a show because it was just her.

1282
01:20:22,322 --> 01:20:26,463
Representing the monologue as the actual suffering of this pagan woman.

1283
01:20:26,523 --> 01:20:30,285
that her son dies crucified, nobody pays attention to him and he is

1284
01:20:30,345 --> 01:20:34,067
like all the suffering of the mother. I have it in Madrid,

1285
01:20:34,127 --> 01:20:37,629
It's super well written too. Well, I want to read it and I would have.

1286
01:20:37,789 --> 01:20:41,091
This Jesuit from 1686 would have loved it. He would have loved it,

1287
01:20:41,271 --> 01:20:44,312
It is literally what he says, of course. He takes crying very seriously.

1288
01:20:44,352 --> 01:20:46,576
of the Virgin, a lot. And in fact,

1289
01:20:48,318 --> 01:20:51,660
he comes into conflict here with certain forms of

1290
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,002
celebrate Holy Thursday and Good Friday. He tells you,

1291
01:20:55,742 --> 01:20:58,985
those who reduce the significance of Holy Thursday and Good Friday to exquisite and indulgent gifts

1292
01:20:59,045 --> 01:21:02,527
delicacies, those who wander the seasons for amusement and alone

1293
01:21:02,587 --> 01:21:06,690
curiosity, those who attend the processions with chatter and jokes.

1294
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:10,752
No, nonsense, it's just that I don't know what it says. with sweet gifted snow waters.

1295
01:21:10,772 --> 01:21:15,054
and chocolates. Look at how the afflicted Virgin passed on Holy Thursday and Good Friday, please".

1296
01:21:15,074 --> 01:21:18,266
Please, a little bit of empathy. Of course, it's because we are already at the end of '17.

1297
01:21:18,276 --> 01:21:22,698
Yeah. Neither meditation of Christ nor anything. What would he think?

1298
01:21:23,298 --> 01:21:26,940
Father José Vidal from the documentary This Wonderful Beautiful Dolores? We love it.

1299
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:31,902
I have seen that he has been nominated for... He has nominations. He has nominations.

1300
01:21:31,963 --> 01:21:35,724
I wish. I found out, I had no idea about the subtleties between.

1301
01:21:35,804 --> 01:21:39,069
nominations and candidacies. Okay, they are not saying it now, but we loved it.

1302
01:21:39,129 --> 01:21:41,855
I loved the documentary very much, it's wonderful. It's marvelous.

1303
01:21:42,396 --> 01:21:43,258
you have to see it, yes.

1304
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:47,872
Well, he is with this thing.

1305
01:21:47,912 --> 01:21:51,073
extremely praising the suffering of the Virgin and it is that,

1306
01:21:51,893 --> 01:21:55,955
just like in the 16th century, from the 17th century onwards there is also like a

1307
01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:59,396
explosion of devotion that has a lot to do with the

1308
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:02,777
arrival of Queen Mariana of Austria to the second

1309
01:22:02,837 --> 01:22:05,839
wife of Philip IV, who greatly promotes the worship,

1310
01:22:06,219 --> 01:22:09,360
above all to the Sorrowful, the Virgin of Sorrows, basically.

1311
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:13,303
that other men have. There is the Virgin of Solitude, depending on how the moment

1312
01:22:13,343 --> 01:22:17,025
about the Virgin's pain and where her tears may be directed, these precious,

1313
01:22:17,166 --> 01:22:20,548
We have the Sorrowful, Virgin of Sorrows, the Solitude, the

1314
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:23,830
Lady of the Transfer, how beautiful, the Virgin of Sorrows,

1315
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:26,252
Our Lady of Tears. All of this is very beautiful.

1316
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:32,298
The thing is that there are many sculptural representations.

1317
01:22:32,318 --> 01:22:36,003
in this time of this crying. It is, for example,

1318
01:22:36,023 --> 01:22:39,466
the Virgin of Macarena, in Seville, which was taken out

1319
01:22:39,506 --> 01:22:40,868
in procession, which is by Luisa Roldá.

1320
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:47,472
We should indeed also dedicate an episode to Luisa Rodán at some point. An episode.

1321
01:22:47,492 --> 01:22:48,592
to female painters,

1322
01:22:48,612 --> 01:22:52,394
sculptors. It's just that

1323
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:57,335
She is extremely precious. Luisa Rodán was a sculptor.

1324
01:22:57,375 --> 01:23:00,817
from the 17th. Although there are those who say that

1325
01:23:00,837 --> 01:23:03,197
These things make me so angry that it was actually the father.

1326
01:23:04,698 --> 01:23:09,141
Yes, forget it. Those precious tears.

1327
01:23:09,201 --> 01:23:13,705
of glass, that is a beauty. And then there are others.

1328
01:23:13,785 --> 01:23:16,947
sculptures, like those of Pedro Mena,

1329
01:23:18,008 --> 01:23:21,330
another sculptor from the same period, in which the

1330
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:25,193
Maria's crying is greatly exaggerated. It is exaggerated more and more.

1331
01:23:26,174 --> 01:23:29,576
and it appears and it's like very real and it's like the face is no longer the same.

1332
01:23:30,076 --> 01:23:34,758
simply beatific, beautiful, isn't it Maria from Santo Domingo being

1333
01:23:35,198 --> 01:23:38,600
a break there of beauty with some tearless

1334
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,502
more, but there is a gesture of pain. And it is here that they begin to

1335
01:23:42,722 --> 01:23:46,143
Worry a lot with this representation and there is pictorial

1336
01:23:46,183 --> 01:23:50,085
and sculptural and there are treaties that go up to the 18th in which they say that

1337
01:23:50,145 --> 01:23:53,955
They cry, but not so much. The 18th, because it's already.

1338
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:57,860
It's like, if there are convulsions, but also even before the 18th, because if there are too many.

1339
01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:01,064
Seizures, if it's like something that takes over your body too much,

1340
01:24:01,084 --> 01:24:04,408
as for there to be, then as with poor Marjorie Kemp,

1341
01:24:04,688 --> 01:24:08,773
if there is sobbing, noisy, snot, let's see

1342
01:24:08,793 --> 01:24:11,915
if this is going to be so physical. Damn! It's going to be.

1343
01:24:11,955 --> 01:24:14,976
the devil or is going to be one, as Saint Teresa also said, let's see

1344
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:18,857
if those cries are going to be a melancholy. Let's see! Let's all run away.

1345
01:24:18,957 --> 01:24:21,918
of melancholy! Today's conclusion is,

1346
01:24:22,378 --> 01:24:25,779
Beware of the tyranny of wanting to look pretty when crying. Maybe you have

1347
01:24:25,799 --> 01:24:28,540
that you let the snot fall on you. It's not the conclusion after all this.

1348
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:32,101
geographical delirium! Analyze yourself,

1349
01:24:32,381 --> 01:24:34,282
Categorize, taxonomize your crying.

1350
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:40,167
And above all, because this is also often said, don't cry alone or

1351
01:24:40,247 --> 01:24:43,888
in front of a lot of people. Cry in front of a few.

1352
01:24:43,948 --> 01:24:46,029
with one hand. This is something we haven't mentioned in the episode,

1353
01:24:46,049 --> 01:24:49,890
but I just took it out myself. And can I do one last thing? Can I dedicate

1354
01:24:49,931 --> 01:24:53,812
the episode? Yes. I just want to dedicate it to the friends and girlfriends who

1355
01:24:53,852 --> 01:24:56,833
in the distance endure all our sorrows, which are many,

1356
01:24:56,873 --> 01:25:00,595
They are a handful of people, they know who they are, who are there standing by.

1357
01:25:00,615 --> 01:25:04,016
from the canyon. Yes, thank you very much. See you in two weeks.

1358
01:25:04,907 --> 01:25:08,189
Hey, Lidia, get your act together! Hey, Lidia, you're not doing anything! Hey,

1359
01:25:08,249 --> 01:25:12,271
Lidia, you're worthless! You're a piece of shit! Hold me back or I'll lose my temper and may my

1360
01:25:12,331 --> 01:25:15,993
directors haven't told me! Man,

1361
01:25:16,013 --> 01:25:21,737
Please! The least! The least!

1362
01:25:21,757 --> 01:25:22,317
At the very least!
